## 1. CORE CV FOUNDATIONS

### 1.1 What is a Face, Computationally?

A face in image space is a **2D projection of a 3D deformable object** with:
- **Appearance variability**: illumination, pose, expression, occlusion, age
- **Structural regularity**: bilateral symmetry, fixed topology (eyes, nose, mouth)
- **High inter-class similarity, low intra-class variation** for recognition tasks

The challenge: maximize **intra-class compactness** and **inter-class separability** in the learned embedding space.

---

### 1.2 Image Representation Fundamentals

#### Pixel Space
- Raw image: H × W × C tensor (uint8, 0–255 or float32 0.0–1.0)
- Face images typically normalized to fixed size (e.g., 112×112 or 160×160)

#### Color Spaces Relevant to Faces
| Space | Relevance |
|-------|-----------|
| **RGB** | Standard CNN input |
| **YCbCr / YUV** | Separate luminance (Y) from chrominance; skin detection robust to lighting |
| **LAB** | Perceptually uniform; useful for illumination normalization |
| **HSV** | Hue for skin segmentation |
| **Grayscale** | Reduces illumination variance; used in classic methods |

#### Frequency Domain
- **Gabor filters**: model V1 cortical simple cells; respond to orientation + frequency → used in classic face recognition (Gabor face)
- **DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform)**: low-frequency components carry identity; discard high-freq lighting variation
- **LBP (Local Binary Pattern)**: encodes local texture gradient sign pattern into an 8-bit code per pixel → histogram over cells gives face descriptor

```
LBP at pixel (xc, yc):
  For each neighbor p in circular neighborhood:
    bit_p = 1 if I(neighbor) >= I(center) else 0
  LBP = concatenate bits → integer code
```

---

### 1.3 Classical Face Feature Engineering

#### HOG — Histogram of Oriented Gradients
1. Compute image gradients (Sobel): Gx, Gy
2. Magnitude = √(Gx² + Gy²), Angle = atan2(Gy, Gx)
3. Divide image into cells (8×8 pixels)
4. Build orientation histogram (9 bins, 0–180°) per cell
5. Normalize over blocks of 2×2 cells (L2-Hys normalization)
6. Concatenate → feature vector

**Why HOG for faces?** Robust to local photometric changes. Captures edge structure (eyebrows, jawline).

#### Eigenfaces (PCA-based, Turk & Pentland 1991)
1. Flatten each face image into a vector: d = H × W
2. Compute mean face μ
3. Center data: X_centered = X − μ
4. PCA → top-k eigenvectors of covariance matrix = "eigenfaces"
5. Project new face into eigenface subspace → low-dim representation
6. Classify via nearest neighbor in eigenspace

**Limitation**: captures appearance variation broadly, not discriminative identity structure. Sensitive to illumination, pose.

#### Fisherfaces (LDA-based, Belhumeur et al. 1997)
- LDA: maximize **between-class scatter** / minimize **within-class scatter**
- **Fisher criterion**: $J(W) = \frac{W^T S_B W}{W^T S_W W}$
- Requires PCA preprocessing (since $S_W$ is singular for high-dim data)
- More discriminative than PCA eigenfaces

#### SIFT / SURF for Faces
- Scale + rotation invariant keypoint descriptors
- Detect stable keypoints around facial landmarks
- Build 128-dim SIFT descriptor per keypoint
- Less common now, superseded by deep features

---

### 1.4 Similarity & Distance Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Use Case |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Euclidean** | $\|f_1 - f_2\|_2$ | Raw embedding distance |
| **Cosine similarity** | $\frac{f_1 \cdot f_2}{\|f_1\|\|f_2\|}$ | After L2 normalization (preferred for face embeddings) |
| **Mahalanobis** | $\sqrt{(x-\mu)^T \Sigma^{-1} (x-\mu)}$ | Accounts for feature correlations |

> **Key insight**: After L2 normalization, Euclidean distance and cosine similarity are equivalent:
> $\|f_1 - f_2\|^2 = 2(1 - \cos\theta)$

**Verification threshold**: A pair is "same person" if cosine_similarity > τ (tuned on validation set).

## 2. DEEP LEARNING ARCHITECTURE CONCEPTS

### 2.1 Convolutional Neural Network Hierarchy (Feature Hierarchy)

```
Input Image
    │
    ▼
[Layer 1–2]  Low-level features: edges, colors, blobs
    │
    ▼
[Layer 3–5]  Mid-level features: textures, eye shapes, nose patterns
    │
    ▼
[Layer 6–N]  High-level semantic features: identity, expression, gender
    │
    ▼
[Embedding]  Compact identity representation (128–512 dim)
    │
    ▼
[Loss Head]  Softmax / ArcFace / Triplet loss
```

**Receptive Field Growth**: each conv layer expands the spatial context a neuron "sees":
$$RF_{l} = RF_{l-1} + (k_l - 1) \times \prod_{i=1}^{l-1} s_i$$

Deeper networks capture global face structure (pose, identity) via large effective receptive fields.

---

### 2.2 Key Architectural Building Blocks

#### Batch Normalization
- Normalize activations: $\hat{x} = \frac{x - \mu_B}{\sqrt{\sigma_B^2 + \epsilon}}$
- Learnable: $y = \gamma \hat{x} + \beta$
- **Effect**: stabilizes training, allows higher LR, slight regularization
- **For face recognition**: BN statistics shift at inference (running mean/var); crucial to freeze BN in fine-tuning

#### Residual Connections (ResNet, He et al. 2015)
$$y = F(x, \{W_i\}) + x$$
- Skip connections allow gradients to flow directly
- Enable very deep networks (50, 100, 152 layers)
- **ResNet-50/100** is the de-facto backbone for modern face recognition (ArcFace, CosFace use it)
- **IR (Improved Residual)** block: BN-Conv-BN-PReLU-Conv-BN (used in InsightFace)

#### Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SE-Net)
- Recalibrate channel-wise feature responses
- Channel attention: $z_c = \frac{1}{H \times W}\sum_{i,j} u_c(i,j)$ → Excitation: $s = \sigma(W_2 \cdot \delta(W_1 z))$
- Used in **SE-ResNet** backbone for face recognition

#### Depthwise Separable Convolutions (MobileNet)
- Standard conv: $D_k^2 \cdot M \cdot N$ multiplications
- Depthwise + Pointwise: $D_k^2 \cdot M + M \cdot N$
- ~8–9x fewer operations → **lightweight face recognition** (MobileFaceNet)

#### Vision Transformer (ViT) for Faces
- Patch tokens: divide 112×112 face into 14×14 = 196 patches
- Multi-head self-attention: models global dependency (e.g., relationship between eyes and nose)
- **FaceTransformer**, **TransFace**: ViT-based face recognition backbones
- Challenge: ViT needs large data; hybrid CNN-ViT often preferred

---

### 2.3 Normalization Strategies

| Method | Normalizes Over | Use Case |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| **Batch Norm (BN)** | Batch × H × W | Face recognition backbones |
| **Layer Norm (LN)** | Channel × H × W | Transformers, small batches |
| **Instance Norm (IN)** | H × W per channel | Style transfer, illumination invariance |
| **Group Norm (GN)** | Groups of channels | When batch size = 1 (detection) |

---

### 2.4 Activation Functions in Face Networks

| Function | Formula | Property |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **ReLU** | max(0, x) | Sparse, dying neuron problem |
| **PReLU** | max(αx, x), learnable α | Used in InsightFace/ArcFace (α ≈ 0.25) |
| **GELU** | $x \Phi(x)$ | Used in transformers |
| **Swish** | $x \cdot \sigma(x)$ | Smooth, non-monotonic |

**InsightFace uses PReLU** throughout — empirically better than ReLU for face recognition.

---

## 3. FACE DETECTION — FROM CLASSIC TO DEEP

### 3.1 Viola-Jones (Haar Cascade, 2001)

**Pipeline**:
1. **Haar-like features**: rectangular difference features computed via integral image in O(1)
2. **AdaBoost**: select weak classifiers (individual Haar features), combine into strong classifier
3. **Cascade of classifiers**: early rejection of non-face windows → fast

**Integral image trick**:
$$I_{int}(x,y) = \sum_{x' \leq x, y' \leq y} I(x', y')$$
Rectangular sum = 4 array lookups regardless of rectangle size.

**Limitations**: sensitive to pose (only frontal), illumination; slow on large images; many false positives.

---

### 3.2 HOG + SVM Face Detector (Dalal & Triggs style)
- Sliding window + HOG features + linear SVM
- Non-maximum suppression (NMS) on overlapping detections
- **Dlib's frontal face detector** uses this approach

---

### 3.3 Deep Learning Face Detectors

#### MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded CNN, Zhang et al. 2016)
Three-stage cascade:
```
Stage 1: P-Net (Proposal Network)
  - Fully convolutional 12×12 network
  - Generates face candidates at multiple scales
  - Outputs: face/non-face probability + bounding box regression

Stage 2: R-Net (Refinement Network)
  - Takes P-Net candidates (24×24 crop)
  - Rejects non-faces, refines bounding boxes
  - Outputs: face/non-face + bbox + 5 facial landmarks

Stage 3: O-Net (Output Network)
  - Takes R-Net candidates (48×48 crop)
  - Final classification + bbox + 5 landmarks (eye centers, nose, mouth corners)
```
**Multi-task learning**: simultaneous detection + landmark localization → shared representation, better generalization.

#### RetinaFace (Deng et al. 2019)
- **Single-stage** detector built on ResNet/MobileNet backbone with FPN
- Multi-scale predictions via **Feature Pyramid Network (FPN)**
- Heads per anchor: face classification + bbox regression + 5 landmark regression + 3D mesh regression
- **Extra supervision** from landmark and dense prediction improves face detection accuracy
- State-of-the-art on WiderFace benchmark

**FPN recap**:
```
C3, C4, C5  ← backbone feature maps (different scales)
     ↓ top-down pathway with lateral connections
P3, P4, P5  ← feature pyramid, each has rich semantic + spatial info
     ↓
Anchor-based detection heads at each Pi
```

#### SCRFD (Sample and Computation Redistribution, 2021)
- Efficient face detector; re-distributes training samples across scales
- Achieves RetinaFace-level accuracy at fraction of FLOPS

---

### 3.4 Anchor Design for Face Detection

| Concept | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Anchors** | Pre-defined boxes at each feature map location |
| **Scales** | Multiple sizes per location to cover face size range |
| **Aspect ratio** | Usually 1:1 for faces (nearly square) |
| **Stride** | Feature map stride determines spatial resolution |
| **IoU threshold** | Positive: IoU > 0.5, Negative: IoU < 0.3 |

**IoU (Intersection over Union)**:
$$\text{IoU} = \frac{\text{Area of Overlap}}{\text{Area of Union}}$$

**NMS (Non-Maximum Suppression)**:
1. Sort detections by confidence score
2. Keep highest-scored box
3. Remove boxes with IoU > threshold with kept box
4. Repeat

---

## 4. FACE ALIGNMENT & PREPROCESSING

### 4.1 Why Alignment Matters

Face recognition accuracy degrades ~10–15% without alignment. CNNs are not fully pose-invariant for large head rotations.

**Goal**: normalize face into a canonical pose so the network sees consistent facial geometry.

### 4.2 2D Similarity Transform Alignment

Given 5 facial landmarks (left eye, right eye, nose tip, left mouth corner, right mouth corner):

1. Define **reference landmark positions** (mean face template at 112×112)
2. Estimate **similarity transform** T (rotation + scale + translation, no shear): 4 DOF
3. Use **Least Squares fit**: minimize $\sum_i \|T(src_i) - dst_i\|^2$
4. Apply `cv2.warpAffine` to crop and align

```python
from skimage.transform import SimilarityTransform
tform = SimilarityTransform()
tform.estimate(src_landmarks, dst_landmarks)
aligned = warp(img, tform.inverse, output_shape=(112, 112))
```

### 4.3 3D Face Alignment (3DMM)
- **3D Morphable Model (Blanz & Vetter 1999)**: face = mean shape + shape PCA + expression PCA
  $$S = \bar{S} + A_{id}\alpha + A_{exp}\beta$$
- Fit 3DMM to 2D image via optimization → recover 3D pose, shape, texture
- **PRNet, 3DDFA**: CNN-based 3D face reconstruction in real-time
- Used for frontal face synthesis from profile views → augment training data

### 4.4 Preprocessing Pipeline

```
Raw image
   ↓ Face detection (RetinaFace / MTCNN)
   ↓ Landmark localization (5-point or 68-point)
   ↓ Similarity transform alignment → 112×112 crop
   ↓ BGR to RGB conversion
   ↓ Pixel normalization: (pixel - 127.5) / 128.0  ← InsightFace standard
   ↓ Tensor [1, 3, 112, 112]
   ↓ Backbone → 512-dim L2-normalized embedding
```

## 5. FACE RECOGNITION PIPELINE

### 5.1 Closed-Set vs Open-Set Recognition

| | Closed-Set | Open-Set |
|--|-----------|----------|
| **Definition** | Test identity is always in training gallery | Unknown identities may appear at test time |
| **Output** | Classification (argmax over N classes) | Similarity score + threshold |
| **Metric** | Top-1 accuracy | TAR@FAR (True Accept Rate at False Accept Rate) |
| **Real world** | Rare | Always (face verification, 1:N search) |

### 5.2 Verification vs Identification

**Verification (1:1)**: Given probe P and claimed identity G, is P = G?
- Compute embedding similarity: $s = \cos(f_P, f_G)$
- Decision: `same` if s > τ, else `different`
- Metric: **ROC curve**, **AUC**, **EER (Equal Error Rate)**

**Identification (1:N)**: Given probe P, who is it among N gallery identities?
- Compute similarity to all gallery embeddings
- Return top-1 match (or reject if max_sim < τ)
- Metric: **Rank-1 accuracy**, **CMC curve (Cumulative Match Characteristic)**

### 5.3 Embedding Normalization

After backbone, apply **L2 normalization**:
$$\hat{f} = \frac{f}{\|f\|_2}$$

All embeddings lie on a **unit hypersphere**. Cosine similarity = dot product.

**Why normalize?** Decouples magnitude (image quality, confidence) from direction (identity direction on sphere).

---

### 5.4 Gallery Building & Feature Database

In production 1:N search:
1. Enroll: compute embedding for each gallery identity (possibly average multiple images)
2. Store: embeddings in a vector database (FAISS, Annoy, ScaNN)
3. Search: Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search → sub-linear lookup time

**FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)**:
- `IndexFlatIP`: exact inner product search (cosine for L2-normalized vectors)
- `IndexIVFFlat`: inverted file index → cluster space, search only nearby clusters
- `IndexHNSW`: graph-based ANN → very fast retrieval

---

## 6. LOSS FUNCTIONS — THE HEART OF FACE RECOGNITION

### 6.1 Softmax Cross-Entropy (Baseline)

$$\mathcal{L} = -\log \frac{e^{W_{y_i}^T f_i + b_{y_i}}}{\sum_j e^{W_j^T f_i + b_j}}$$

**Problem**: optimizes for classification accuracy but does NOT explicitly enforce:
- Intra-class compactness
- Inter-class margin

Face embeddings trained with plain softmax have overlapping clusters → poor verification performance.

---

### 6.2 Contrastive Loss (Chopra et al. 2005)

$$\mathcal{L} = y \cdot d^2 + (1-y) \cdot \max(0, m - d)^2$$

- y=1: same person, minimize distance d
- y=0: different persons, push distance > margin m
- **Pairwise**: requires careful pair mining; slow convergence; sensitive to margin

---

### 6.3 Triplet Loss (FaceNet, Schroff et al. 2015)

$$\mathcal{L} = \sum_i \max(0, \|f_a^i - f_p^i\|^2 - \|f_a^i - f_n^i\|^2 + \alpha)$$

- Anchor (a), Positive (p = same person), Negative (n = different person)
- Learn: $d(a,p) + \alpha < d(a,n)$
- **Margin α**: typically 0.2–0.5

**Triplet Mining** (critical for convergence):
| Strategy | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Random** | All valid triplets; most are trivial (easy negatives) |
| **Hard negative** | $\arg\min_n d(a,n)$: closest negative; unstable, may collapse |
| **Semi-hard** | $d(a,p) < d(a,n) < d(a,p) + \alpha$: non-trivial but valid |
| **Batch Hard** | Per-batch hardest positive + hardest negative per anchor |

**FaceNet result**: 128-dim embedding, 99.63% LFW accuracy.

---

### 6.4 ArcFace / CosFace / SphereFace — Angular Margin Losses

All three remove bias b, normalize weight vectors W and features f, operate in angular space:

$$\cos\theta_j = \hat{W}_j^T \hat{f}_i, \quad \hat{W}_j = \frac{W_j}{\|W_j\|}, \quad \hat{f}_i = \frac{f_i}{\|f_i\|}$$

#### SphereFace (A-Softmax, Liu et al. 2017)
$$\mathcal{L} = -\log \frac{e^{s \cdot \cos(m\theta_{y_i})}}{e^{s \cdot \cos(m\theta_{y_i})} + \sum_{j \neq y_i} e^{s \cdot \cos\theta_j}}$$
- Multiplicative angular margin: $m\theta$ (m integer, e.g., m=4)
- Hard to train; requires piecewise function trick

#### CosFace (LMCL, Wang et al. 2018)
$$\mathcal{L} = -\log \frac{e^{s(\cos\theta_{y_i} - m)}}{e^{s(\cos\theta_{y_i} - m)} + \sum_{j \neq y_i} e^{s \cdot \cos\theta_j}}$$
- Additive cosine margin m (e.g., 0.35)
- Simpler, stable training

#### ArcFace (Deng et al. 2019) ★ Most Widely Used
$$\mathcal{L} = -\log \frac{e^{s \cdot \cos(\theta_{y_i} + m)}}{e^{s \cdot \cos(\theta_{y_i} + m)} + \sum_{j \neq y_i} e^{s \cdot \cos\theta_j}}$$
- Additive **angular** margin m (e.g., m=0.5 radians ≈ 28.6°)
- Scale s = 64 (controls softmax temperature)
- Geometric interpretation: margin directly in angle space on hypersphere
- **99.82% on LFW**, SOTA on IJB-B/C

**Geometric intuition**:

```
Without margin:              With ArcFace margin m:
                                
   Class A    Class B            Class A |m| Class B
      ●           ●                 ●  ← margin →  ●
   decision boundary              clear separation
```

**Comparison**:
| Loss | Margin Type | Formula | Stability |
|------|------------|---------|-----------|
| SphereFace | Multiplicative angular | cos(mθ) | Hard to train |
| CosFace | Additive cosine | cos(θ) - m | Good |
| ArcFace | Additive angular | cos(θ + m) | Best |

---

### 6.5 Advanced Loss Variants (Research Level)

| Loss | Innovation |
|------|-----------|
| **CurricularFace** | Adaptive hard negative weighting based on training stage |
| **MagFace** | Magnitude-aware: larger magnitude = higher quality = larger margin |
| **AdaFace** | Adaptive margin based on image quality (low quality → smaller margin) |
| **ElasticFace** | Elastic (random) margin sampled from distribution per iteration |
| **NPCFace** | Negative cosine pair constraint |

---

## 7. FACE ANALYSIS TASKS

### 7.1 Face Attribute Recognition

**Goal**: predict discrete or continuous attributes from face image.
- **Binary**: glasses, beard, smile, makeup, hat
- **Continuous**: age (regression), attractiveness score
- **Multi-label**: simultaneous prediction of N attributes

**CelebA dataset**: 202,599 images × 40 binary attributes

**Architecture**: shared backbone (ResNet/EfficientNet) + per-attribute head
```
Input face (112×112)
   → Backbone → 2048-dim features
   → Attribute head 1: smile?    [sigmoid + BCE loss]
   → Attribute head 2: glasses?  [sigmoid + BCE loss]
   → Age head:         age (0-100) [regression + L1/MSE loss]
```

**Attention-based attribute prediction**: spatial attention highlights relevant face region (e.g., mouth region for smile).

---

### 7.2 Facial Expression Recognition (FER)

**7 basic emotions** (Ekman): Anger, Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Sadness, Surprise, Neutral

**Challenges**:
- Ambiguous labels (inter-annotator disagreement)
- Compound expressions
- Occlusion (masked faces)
- Subject variability

**Methods**:

| Approach | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **CNN classification** | AffectNet (450K images), FER2013, RAF-DB datasets |
| **Graph CNN (AU-based)** | Face Action Units (FACS) → graph nodes → GCN classifies expression |
| **Temporal modeling** | LSTM / Transformer over video frames → dynamic expression |
| **Label distribution learning** | Treat ambiguous labels as distributions, not hard labels |

**Action Units (FACS — Facial Action Coding System)**:
- AU1: inner brow raise; AU6: cheek raise; AU12: lip corner pull (smile)
- Expressions = combinations of AUs
- 44 AUs defined; detection is multi-label binary classification

---

### 7.3 Age Estimation

**Approaches**:

| Method | Formulation |
|--------|------------|
| **Regression** | MSE/L1 loss; output single age value |
| **Classification** | Bin ages into groups (0-10, 11-20, ...); CrossEntropy |
| **Ordinal regression** | Binary classifiers: age > 10? age > 20? ... → sum predictions |
| **Distribution learning** | DEX: predict distribution over age labels, expectation = age |
| **DLDL (Label Distribution)** | Gaussian label distribution centered at true age |

**DEX (Deep EXpectation)**:
$$\hat{a} = \sum_{i=1}^{101} i \cdot p(i|x)$$
where p(i|x) is softmax over 101 age classes.

---

### 7.4 Gender & Race/Ethnicity Classification

**Gender**: binary classification (male/female) — >99% accuracy achievable
**Race/Ethnicity**: multi-class (6 categories in FairFace dataset)

**Fairness considerations** (critical for senior interviews):
- Models exhibit differential accuracy across demographic groups
- **Disparate performance**: lower accuracy on darker skin tones (documented in gender classifiers: Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018)
- Mitigation: balanced datasets, adversarial debiasing, fairness constraints

---

### 7.5 Head Pose Estimation

**Euler Angles**: Yaw (left-right), Pitch (up-down), Roll (tilt)

**Methods**:
| Method | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Landmark-based** | PnP (Perspective-n-Point): map 2D landmarks → 3D model → solve rotation/translation via RANSAC+PnP |
| **Direct regression** | CNN regresses 3 angles directly from cropped face |
| **Hopenet** | Multi-loss: classification + regression per angle |
| **FSA-Net** | Feature aggregation with stage weights; compact model |

**PnP-based pipeline (OpenCV)**:
```python
# 3D model points (generic face)
model_points = np.array([...68 3D landmarks...])
# Detected 2D points
image_points = np.array([...detected 68 landmarks...])
# Solve
_, rvec, tvec = cv2.solvePnP(model_points, image_points, camera_matrix, dist_coeffs)
rmat, _ = cv2.Rodrigues(rvec)
# Extract Euler angles from rotation matrix
```

---

### 7.6 Facial Landmark Detection

**68-point model** (iBUG annotation): jawline(17) + eyebrows(10) + nose(9) + eyes(12) + mouth(20)

**Methods Evolution**:
| Era | Method |
|-----|--------|
| Classic | ASM (Active Shape Model), AAM (Active Appearance Model) |
| Deep regression | Direct heatmap regression or coordinate regression |
| **HRNet** | High-resolution representation maintained throughout network |
| **Hourglass (Stacked)** | Repeated downsample + upsample, intermediate supervision |
| **FAN (Face Alignment Network)** | Multi-scale attention + stacked hourglass |

**Heatmap regression**:
- Predict H×W Gaussian heatmap per landmark
- Landmark location = argmax of heatmap
- Loss: MSE between predicted and ground-truth Gaussian heatmaps
- Advantage: captures uncertainty; richer supervision signal than coordinate regression

---

### 7.7 Face Anti-Spoofing (Liveness Detection)

**Attack types**:
- **Print attack**: photo printout
- **Replay attack**: video on screen
- **3D mask attack**: realistic 3D mask

**Detection approaches**:
| Method | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Texture analysis** | LBP: real faces have richer micro-texture than printouts |
| **Depth map estimation** | Real faces have 3D depth; predict pseudo-depth map |
| **rPPG (remote PPG)** | Detect subtle skin color changes from heartbeat (absent in photos) |
| **Binary cross-entropy** | CNN trained real/spoof; limited generalization |
| **Domain generalization** | Train on multiple domains → generalize to unseen attack types |
| **CDCN** | Central Difference CNN: captures intrinsic patterns |

---

## 9. ADVANCED & RESEARCH-LEVEL TOPICS

### 9.1 Face Generation & Synthesis (GANs / Diffusion)

**StyleGAN / StyleGAN2/3**:
- Disentangled latent space (W/W+ space): coarse (pose, face shape) vs fine (texture, color) control
- **Style injection**: AdaIN (Adaptive Instance Normalization)
  $$\text{AdaIN}(x, y) = y_s \cdot \frac{x - \mu(x)}{\sigma(x)} + y_b$$
- Applications: face editing, aging, expression transfer, identity-preserving synthesis

**Diffusion models for faces**:
- DDPM: iterative denoising → high fidelity, diverse
- Face-specific: text-guided face editing (DiffusionCLIP), face inpainting, super-resolution

---

### 9.2 Face Recognition under Occlusion & Masked Faces

Post-COVID challenge: face masks occlude lower half.
- **Periocular recognition**: eyes/forehead region only
- **Part-based models**: attention masks to weight visible regions
- **Occlusion-robust training**: augment with random occlusion (SimMask, MaskedFace)
- **MFR2021 (Masked Face Recognition Challenge)**: benchmark with masked subjects

---

### 9.3 3D Face Recognition

**Why 3D?** Illumination/pose invariant by nature.

**Methods**:
- **Depth sensor** (Kinect, structured light): direct 3D point cloud
- **Photometric stereo**: multiple images under different illumination → surface normals
- **3D-to-2D matching**: render 3D model from multiple angles → compare 2D embeddings

### 9.4 Deepfake Detection

Face manipulation types:
| Type | Method |
|------|--------|
| **Face swap** | FaceSwap, DeepFaceLab |
| **Face reenactment** | First Order Model, Face2Face |
| **Attribute editing** | GAN-based aging, expression change |
| **Fully synthetic** | StyleGAN generated faces |

**Detection methods**:
- **Frequency artifacts**: GAN upsampling leaves checkerboard patterns in FFT spectrum
- **Blending boundary** detection: detect seam artifacts between swapped face + background
- **Temporal inconsistency**: eye blinking, head motion anomalies
- **Biological signals**: rPPG inconsistencies in swapped faces

**Datasets**: FaceForensics++, DFDC, Celeb-DF

---

### 9.5 Privacy-Preserving Face Recognition

**Federated Learning**:
- Train face model without centralizing face data
- Clients compute gradients locally; server aggregates
- Challenge: non-IID data (each client has different identities)

**Homomorphic Encryption**:
- Compute on encrypted embeddings: compare faces without decrypting
- Slow but cryptographically secure

**Differential Privacy**:
- Add calibrated noise to gradients (DP-SGD) to prevent memorization
- Trade-off: privacy budget ε vs model accuracy

---

### 9.6 Quality-Aware Face Recognition

**Insight**: Low-quality faces (blur, low-res, extreme pose) should be weighted less.

**MagFace**: embedding magnitude = quality proxy
$$\mathcal{L}_{mag} = \mathcal{L}_{ArcFace}(\hat{f}) + \lambda g(a)$$
- Large ||f|| → high quality → larger margin
- Small ||f|| → low quality → smaller margin (penalized less)

**AdaFace**: adapt margin based on image quality estimator
$$\mathcal{L}_{AdaFace} = -\log \frac{e^{s(\cos\theta + m(q))}}{...}$$
where m(q) is quality-dependent margin.

---

### 9.7 Domain Adaptation for Face Recognition

**Problem**: model trained on web images fails on surveillance cameras (different domain).
- **Fine-tuning**: small labeled target domain data
- **Domain adversarial training**: feature extractor fools domain discriminator
- **Pseudo-labeling**: cluster unlabeled target data → self-supervised fine-tuning

## 10. SENIOR INTERVIEW Q&A

### Architecture Questions

**Q: Why use ArcFace over Triplet Loss?**
> ArcFace is more computationally efficient (no pair/triplet mining), more stable (no hard negative selection), geometrically cleaner (explicit angular margin on hypersphere), and achieves better or equal performance. Triplet loss scales O(N³) in pairs; ArcFace scales O(N) in samples.

**Q: What's the role of the scale parameter s in ArcFace?**
> s controls the "temperature" of the softmax. After L2 normalization, all features lie on a unit sphere with activations in [-1, 1]. Without scaling, gradients become too small. s=64 maps cosine similarity to a reasonable logit range, enabling effective gradient flow. Too large → training instability; too small → underfitting.

**Q: ResNet vs ViT backbone for face recognition — trade-offs?**
> ResNet: translation equivariance, inductive bias, works well on small data, faster convergence. ViT: global self-attention captures long-range dependencies (useful for pose reasoning), scales better with large data, but needs more data and compute. Hybrid CNN-ViT (e.g., CvT) often outperforms both. For production, ResNet-50/100 (IR) is standard.

**Q: How does BN interact with face recognition training?**
> BN normalizes per-batch, which introduces cross-sample interactions. For small-batch face training, running statistics may be inaccurate. BN should be frozen when fine-tuning on small datasets to prevent statistics from shifting. Some papers propose GN or Layer Norm for very small batch sizes. InsightFace uses BN in backbone but freezes it when fine-tuning on domain-specific data.

---

### Loss Function Questions

**Q: Explain the geometric interpretation of ArcFace.**
> Normalize all weight vectors and features onto a unit hypersphere. The logit for class yi is cos(θ_{yi}). ArcFace adds margin m directly to the angle: cos(θ_{yi} + m). This means the decision boundary in angle space shifts inward by m radians for the ground-truth class, forcing the feature to be more tightly clustered around its class center. All N class centers are like N "poles" on the hypersphere, and face embeddings cluster around their respective pole with margin m separating them from adjacent poles.

**Q: What is CurricularFace and why does it outperform ArcFace?**
> CurricularFace introduces curriculum learning into the loss. In early training, it focuses on easy samples; as training progresses, it adaptively increases weight on hard samples. For hard negatives (cos_θ_n > cos_θ_yi), their contribution is amplified by a factor t·cos_θ_n (t increases during training). This prevents hard negatives from dominating early training while ensuring they drive final convergence.

---

### System Design Questions

**Q: Design a face recognition system for 1M identities at <100ms latency.**

> 1. **Enrollment**: extract 512-dim L2-normalized embedding per enrolled image (avg multiple shots per identity)
> 2. **Index**: FAISS IndexIVFPQ (inverted file + product quantization) for 1M vectors; ~100ms for ANN search
> 3. **Inference pipeline**: GPU batching → detection → alignment → backbone inference → L2 norm → FAISS query
> 4. **Quality gating**: reject low-quality probes (MagFace magnitude < threshold)
> 5. **Multi-frame fusion**: for video, aggregate embeddings (quality-weighted average)
> 6. **Threshold calibration**: ROC on validation set, tune TAR@FAR=1e-4 operating point
> 7. **Monitoring**: track FAR/TAR drift in production; retrain if distribution shift

**Q: How do you handle imbalanced identities in training data?**
> Class-balanced sampling: sample equal identities per batch, then equal images per identity. Instance-level weighting based on sample hardness. Use curriculum learning. For extreme imbalance, consider loss weighting or oversampling minority identities.

---

### Research-Level Questions

**Q: What are the key failure modes of face recognition systems?**
> 1. **Demographic bias**: lower accuracy on darker skin, females (data imbalance)
> 2. **Illumination extremes**: backlighting, shadows
> 3. **Large pose**: >60° yaw → profile face, very different from frontal gallery
> 4. **Occlusion**: sunglasses, masks, hair
> 5. **Aging**: large age gap between gallery and probe
> 6. **Image quality**: motion blur, low resolution, compression artifacts
> 7. **Identical twins**: inter-class similarity too high
> 8. **Adversarial attacks**: imperceptible perturbations fool embeddings

**Q: How does MagFace improve upon ArcFace conceptually?**
> ArcFace assigns the same margin to all samples regardless of quality. MagFace links embedding magnitude to image quality: high-quality faces produce larger-magnitude embeddings and receive a harder margin; low-quality faces receive a softer margin. This acts as a built-in quality-aware weighting without an explicit quality estimator. The loss also regularizes magnitude toward a target range, preventing degenerate solutions.

## 11. INTERVIEW Q&A LOG

---

### Q: What is a deformable object in the context of face recognition?

**A (Basic):**
A **deformable object** is any object whose shape or appearance can change while still being recognized as the same thing. A rigid object (like a mug) always has the same geometry. A human face is deformable — it smiles, frowns, tilts, and ages — yet it is still the same identity.

**Deformations in a face:**

| Deformation Type | Example | What Changes |
|-----------------|---------|-------------|
| **Expression** | Smiling vs neutral | Mouth stretches, cheeks rise, eye shape changes |
| **Pose** | Frontal vs profile | 2D projection of 3D geometry changes drastically |
| **Illumination** | Bright sunlight vs shadow | Pixel intensity distribution shifts |
| **Age** | Child vs adult | Bone structure, skin texture, fat distribution |
| **Occlusion** | Glasses, mask, hair | Parts of the face are hidden |

All of these produce **intra-class variation** — same identity, very different pixel appearance.

---

**A (CV/Math Level):**

A face is a **2D projection of a 3D deformable surface**:

$$I(x, y) = \text{Projection}_{camera}\Big(\underbrace{R \cdot S(\alpha, \beta)}_{\text{3D shape}} + T\Big) + \text{Illumination}$$

Where:
- $S(\alpha, \beta)$ = 3D face shape (deformed by expression $\alpha$, identity $\beta$)
- $R$ = rotation matrix (head pose)
- $T$ = translation

Given only the 2D image $I(x,y)$, recovering identity means inverting this highly under-constrained equation — that is the core difficulty of face recognition.

---

**A (Deep Learning Level):**

Deep CNNs learn **deformation-invariant representations** through:
1. **Local pooling**: small spatial shifts → same activation
2. **Data augmentation**: model sees flipped, rotated, occluded faces during training
3. **Deep feature hierarchy**: high-level layers respond to identity concept, not pixel pattern
4. **Angular margin losses (ArcFace)**: force embeddings of same person (across all deformations) to cluster tightly on the unit hypersphere

The ideal embedding satisfies:
$$\|f(\text{smile}) - f(\text{neutral})\| \ll \|f(\text{person A}) - f(\text{person B})\|$$

---

**A (Research Level — Explicit Deformable Models):**

| Model | Formula | Meaning |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **3DMM (Blanz & Vetter 1999)** | $S = \bar{S} + A_{id}\alpha + A_{exp}\beta$ | Separates identity deformation from expression deformation |
| **Active Shape Model (ASM)** | Shape = mean + PCA eigenvectors | Iteratively fits deformation modes to a new image |
| **Thin Plate Spline (TPS)** | Non-rigid warp minimizing bending energy | Warps one face to another via control point correspondences |

**3DMM** is the gold standard mathematical definition: it explicitly factors a face into a mean shape plus independent identity and expression deformation bases, directly encoding the concept of deformability.

**One-line summary**: A deformable object's shape/appearance varies continuously due to physical or environmental factors. For faces, pose, expression, illumination, and aging all change the 2D image while the underlying 3D identity structure remains the same — and face recognition's goal is to learn features invariant to all these deformations.

---

### Q: "Deep feature hierarchy — high-level layers respond to identity concept, not pixel pattern." Explain this.

**A (Core Idea):**
When a CNN processes a face image, each layer transforms the input into increasingly **abstract representations**. Early layers see raw pixels. Deep layers see *who this person is* — completely detached from lighting, pose, or expression.

---

**A (Layer-by-Layer Breakdown — ResNet-50, 112×112 face):**

```
Input: Raw pixel values [0–255] → normalized to [-1, 1]
         ↓
Layer 1–2 (7×7, 3×3 conv)
  → Detect: edges, color boundaries, brightness gradients
  → A pixel responds to: "there is a dark-to-light transition here"
  → Pose changes? → DIFFERENT activation
  → Same person smiling vs neutral? → DIFFERENT activation
         ↓
Layer 3–8 (early residual blocks)
  → Detect: blobs, corners, simple textures
  → "This looks like an eye-shaped region"
  → "There's a curved edge that looks like a nostril"
  → Still fairly sensitive to illumination and pose
         ↓
Layer 9–20 (mid residual blocks)
  → Detect: face parts — eye, nose bridge, lip contour
  → "There is an eye with double eyelid structure"
  → "The inter-ocular distance is ~X units"
  → Starting to capture structural relationships
         ↓
Layer 21–50 (deep residual blocks)
  → Detect: abstract identity patterns
  → "This face belongs to the same cluster as other images of Person A"
  → Does NOT care: whether they're smiling or not
  → Does NOT care: whether light is from left or right
  → Does NOT care: whether it's a 30° rotated view
         ↓
Embedding layer (512-dim vector)
  → Pure identity direction on unit hypersphere
  → f(person_A_smiling) ≈ f(person_A_neutral)
  → f(person_A) ≠ f(person_B) regardless of expression
```

---

**A (Why Does This Happen? Three Mechanisms):**

**1. Receptive Field Growth**

$$RF_l = RF_{l-1} + (k_l - 1) \times \prod_{i=1}^{l-1} s_i$$

- Layer 1 neuron: sees 7×7 patch → just a local edge
- Layer 10 neuron: sees ~30×30 patch → can see an entire eye
- Layer 40 neuron: sees the **entire face** → reasons about global structure (face shape, bone geometry unique to Person A)

**2. Data Augmentation Forces Invariance**
During training, the same person appears with different lighting, expressions, and poses — all with the same label. The loss says: *"all these must map to the same point on the hypersphere."* The network is forced to discard surface-level variation and retain only identity signal.

**3. Discriminative Pressure from ArcFace Loss**
- **Intra-class compactness**: all images of Person A must cluster tightly → discard expression/lighting
- **Inter-class separation**: Person A and Person B must be far apart → capture bone structure, facial geometry, fine-scale texture
- The only signal surviving both constraints is **identity**

---

**A (What Research Visualizations Show):**

| Layer Depth | What Activates Strongly | Invariant To |
|-------------|------------------------|-------------|
| Conv1 | Gabor-like edges, color blobs | Nothing yet |
| Conv5–10 | Eye textures, skin patches | Small translations |
| Conv20–30 | Eye/nose/mouth part detectors | Moderate illumination |
| Conv40–50 | Holistic identity patterns | Expression, lighting, mild pose |
| Embedding | Identity direction | Almost everything except identity |

**Grad-CAM on ResNet-50 (ArcFace)**: deep layer activations spread over the entire face — jawline, eye spacing, forehead shape — not just the most salient local feature.

---

**A (Intuitive Analogy):**
Recognizing a friend's **voice**:
- Pixel layer = detecting individual sound wave oscillations
- Mid layer = detecting phonemes, words
- Deep layer = "this is John's voice" — regardless of whispering, shouting, or having a cold

The deep layer abstracts away all surface variation and extracts the core identity signature.

---

**Punchline for interviews:**
> Classical methods (HOG, LBP, Eigenfaces) operate at the pixel/texture layer — fundamentally sensitive to deformations. Deep networks trained with discriminative losses on millions of faces develop high-level identity neurons that are inherently deformation-invariant because the training signal *forces* them to be. This is why deep face recognition went from ~85% to ~99.8% on LFW — not just more parameters, but qualitatively different feature representations.

---

### Q: Thin Plate Spline (TPS) — "Minimizes bending energy while interpolating control point correspondences." Explain this.

---

**A (Basic — Physical Intuition):**

The name comes from a literal physical analogy:

> Imagine a thin metal sheet (like a sheet of steel). You pin it at specific points and force it to pass through those points. The sheet bends as smoothly as possible to connect all the pinned points — it doesn't crinkle, fold, or crease unnecessarily.

**TPS is the mathematical version of that.**

- **Control points** = the pins
- **Correspondences** = where each pin in the source maps to in the target
- **Bending energy** = how much the sheet has to warp (lower = smoother)
- **Interpolation** = the warp passes exactly through every control point, and smoothly fills in the rest

---

**A (Applied to Faces):**

In face alignment, you have:
- **Source control points**: detected facial landmarks on the input face (e.g., 68 points — eye corners, nose tip, lip corners)
- **Target control points**: the same landmarks on a reference canonical face template

TPS finds a smooth 2D mapping $T: (x, y) \rightarrow (x', y')$ such that:
1. Every source landmark maps **exactly** to its target landmark (interpolation)
2. The warp between landmarks is as **smooth as possible** (minimum bending energy)
3. No artificial creases or discontinuities in the transformation

```
Source face landmarks:           Target template landmarks:
  left_eye  = (45, 60)    →        left_eye  = (38, 51)
  right_eye = (75, 58)    →        right_eye = (74, 51)
  nose_tip  = (60, 80)    →        nose_tip  = (56, 71)
  ...                              ...

TPS finds a smooth warp that satisfies ALL these simultaneously
```

---

**A (Mathematics):**

The TPS transformation for 2D → 2D is:

$$f(x, y) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 y + \sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i \, U\!\left(\|P - P_i\|\right)$$

Where:
- $a_0, a_1, a_2$ = affine component (global translation, rotation, scale)
- $w_i$ = weights for each control point $P_i$
- $N$ = number of control points
- $U(r) = r^2 \log(r^2)$ = **radial basis function** (the TPS kernel)

**The kernel $U(r) = r^2 \log r^2$** is the key — it is the Green's function of the biharmonic operator $\nabla^4$, which is exactly what describes bending of a thin plate.

---

**A (Bending Energy — What is it Exactly?):**

Bending energy measures how much a surface curves:

$$E_{bend}(f) = \iint \left[ \left(\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}\right)^2 + 2\left(\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2}\right)^2 \right] dx\, dy$$

This is the sum of squared second derivatives over the entire 2D plane.

- **Second derivative = 0** everywhere → perfectly flat (affine transform = zero bending energy)
- **Large second derivative** → sharp bends, creases → high bending energy

TPS solves:

$$\min_{f} \; E_{bend}(f) \quad \text{subject to} \quad f(P_i) = Q_i \; \forall i$$

Minimize bending energy **while** passing exactly through all control point correspondences.

**This is a constrained optimization with a closed-form solution** — solved via a linear system:

$$\begin{bmatrix} K & P \\ P^T & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} w \\ a \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} Q \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$$

Where $K_{ij} = U(\|P_i - P_j\|)$, $P$ is the matrix of control point coordinates (homogeneous), $Q$ is target positions.

---

**A (Why TPS for Faces Specifically?):**

| Property | Why It Matters for Faces |
|----------|--------------------------|
| **Exact interpolation** | Landmarks are pinned precisely — eye corner goes exactly to canonical position |
| **Smooth between landmarks** | Skin between eye and nose warps naturally, no tearing |
| **Non-rigid** | Can handle asymmetric faces, slight pose differences that affine can't |
| **Affine included** | The $a_0 + a_1x + a_2y$ term handles global scale/rotation; TPS adds local correction on top |
| **Closed-form solution** | No iterative optimization needed; fast at inference |

**Comparison: Similarity Transform vs TPS**

| | Similarity Transform | TPS |
|--|---------------------|-----|
| DOF | 4 (rotation, scale, translation x2) | $2(N+3)$ — one per control point + affine |
| Rigid? | Yes | No — fully non-rigid |
| Landmark fit | Least-squares (not exact) | Exact interpolation |
| Use case | Standard face alignment (5-pt) | Dense warping, face swap, expression transfer |

---

**A (Where TPS Is Used in Face Analysis):**

1. **Face normalization**: warp probe face to canonical template using 68 landmarks → reduces pose variation before recognition
2. **Face morphing / face swap**: smoothly blend one face geometry onto another
3. **Expression transfer (Face2Face, First Order Model)**: warp source expression onto target identity
4. **Data augmentation**: synthetically deform faces to simulate pose/expression variation
5. **3DMM fitting**: TPS used as a 2D approximation before full 3D fitting

---

```

---

**Punchline for interviews:**
> TPS is the mathematically optimal smooth non-rigid warp: it finds the unique transformation that (1) maps every source landmark exactly to its target, and (2) does so with the least possible bending — meaning no unnecessary distortion anywhere in the image. It is the gold standard for non-rigid face alignment because it is physically motivated, has a closed-form solution, and handles the non-linear deformations that affine transforms cannot.

---

### Q: Why HOG for faces? "Robust to local photometric changes. Captures edge structure (eyebrows, jawline)." Explain this.

---

**A (What is a Photometric Change?):**

**Photometry** = measurement of light intensity in an image.
**Photometric changes** = anything that alters pixel brightness/color **without changing the 3D face structure**:

| Photometric Change | What Happens to Pixels | Face Structure Changed? |
|-------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Bright sunlight from left | Left side pixels → very bright | No |
| Dim indoor lighting | All pixels → darker overall | No |
| Shadow across nose | Nose pixels → suddenly dark | No |
| Camera flash | Global pixel boost | No |
| Slight skin tone difference | Absolute RGB values differ | No |

A good face descriptor should be insensitive to these changes — the eyebrows and jawline are physically in the same place regardless of lighting.

---

**A (Why HOG is Robust to Photometric Changes):**

HOG never looks at **absolute pixel values**. It only looks at **local gradient directions**.

**Gradient computation (Sobel):**
```
Gx = pixel_right - pixel_left   (horizontal change)
Gy = pixel_bottom - pixel_top   (vertical change)

Magnitude = √(Gx² + Gy²)
Angle     = atan2(Gy, Gx)
```

A gradient fires at a **boundary** where brightness transitions — it does NOT care about the absolute brightness level.

**Concrete example — the eyebrow edge:**
```
Dim lighting:    [40, 42, 43, 80, 82, 83]   ← skin then eyebrow
Bright lighting: [140,142,143,180,182,183]   ← same face, more light

Gx (dim):    80 - 42  = 38  → angle ≈ 0°
Gx (bright): 180 - 142 = 38  → angle ≈ 0°  (identical!)
```

Global illumination offset $c$ cancels in subtraction:
$$G_x = I(x+1) - I(x-1) = [I_0 + c] - [I_0' + c] = I_0 - I_0'$$

**Block normalization (L2-Hys)** further handles local contrast variation — each 2×2 block of cells normalizes independently, so a shadow on one side of the face doesn't corrupt the entire descriptor.

---

**A (Why HOG Captures Discriminative Edge Structure):**

Faces have **consistent, structurally meaningful edges** at predictable locations:

```
  ─────────────────────  ← hairline (strong horizontal gradient)
       ╲   ╱              ← eyebrow edges (diagonal gradients)
       ( ○ )              ← eye edges (circular gradient pattern)
         |                ← nose bridge (vertical edge)
       ╲___╱              ← nostril edges
         ─                ← lip edges (strong horizontal)
   ─────────────────      ← jawline (strong horizontal/diagonal)
```

Each is an intensity boundary → HOG fires strongly there.

| Facial Edge | Identity Information Carried |
|------------|----------------------------|
| **Eyebrow shape** | Arch height, thickness, gap from eye |
| **Jawline contour** | Round vs square vs pointed |
| **Eye opening** | Almond vs round, drooping vs upturned |
| **Nose bridge** | Narrow vs wide, height |
| **Lip border** | Cupid's bow shape, fullness boundary |

These structural edges are **stable across illumination and mild expression** — the jawline edge doesn't disappear when you smile.

---

**A (HOG vs Raw Pixels — Concrete Comparison):**

```
Same person, two lighting conditions:

Raw pixels (dim):   [40,  55,  48,  32,  80,  91 ...]
Raw pixels (bright):[140, 155, 148, 132, 180, 191 ...]
Euclidean distance → LARGE (looks like different people!)

HOG (dim):   [0.12, 0.45, 0.33, 0.08, ...]
HOG (bright):[0.11, 0.44, 0.34, 0.09, ...]

**A (Limitation HOG Cannot Overcome):**

| Failure Case | Why HOG Fails |
|-------------|--------------|
| Large pose (>30°) | Profile jawline/nose edge pattern is completely different from frontal |
| Large expression | Open mouth deforms lower face edge structure significantly |
| Fine-grained texture | HOG discards per-pixel skin detail (freckles, pores) — loses fine identity cues |

This is precisely the gap deep learning fills — it learns multi-scale features capturing both coarse edge structure **and** fine texture, while learning pose invariance through training data diversity.

---

**Punchline for interviews:**
> HOG is robust to photometric changes because it encodes gradient **directions and relative magnitudes** rather than absolute pixel values — a global illumination shift cancels in the gradient computation. It captures face identity because facial structure (eyebrows, jawline, nose bridge) manifests as consistent, stable edge patterns at predictable locations, which HOG's oriented histogram representation encodes compactly and discriminatively.

---

### Q: Eigenfaces — "PCA → top-k eigenvectors of covariance matrix = eigenfaces." Explain this.

---

**A (Basic — Core Idea):**

Every face image (say 100×100 pixels) is a point in a **10,000-dimensional space** (one dimension per pixel). But faces don't occupy this space randomly — they cluster in a small **subspace** because all faces share similar structure (two eyes, a nose, a mouth).

**PCA finds that subspace.** The eigenfaces are the **principal directions of variation** in face space — the most important ways faces differ from each other.

---

**A (Step-by-Step):**

**Step 1: Flatten each image into a vector**
```
Image (100×100) → vector of length d = 10,000
Data matrix X: shape (N × d)
```

**Step 2: Compute the mean face**
$$\mu = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i$$
The mean face = average of all training face pixel values — looks like a blurry, generic face.

**Step 3: Center the data**
$$\tilde{X} = X - \mu$$
Each face vector now represents **deviation from the average face**.

**Step 4: Compute the covariance matrix**
$$C = \frac{1}{N} \tilde{X}^T \tilde{X} \quad \text{shape: } (d \times d)$$
$C_{ij}$ = how much pixel $i$ and pixel $j$ vary together across all faces. Encodes the full correlation structure of all pixels.

> **Practical trick**: $C$ is $d \times d$ (10,000 × 10,000) — too expensive. Instead compute eigenvectors of the smaller $N \times N$ matrix $\tilde{X}\tilde{X}^T$, then project back. When $N \ll d$ this is dramatically faster.

**Step 5: Compute top-k eigenvectors of C**
$$C \, v_i = \lambda_i \, v_i$$
- $v_i$ = eigenvector (shape: $d \times 1$ = same size as a face image)
- $\lambda_i$ = eigenvalue = **amount of variance explained** by this direction
- Sort by $\lambda_i$ descending → top-k eigenvectors capture the most variation
- Reshaped back to $H \times W$ → these are the **eigenfaces**

---

**A (What Eigenfaces Look Like):**

```
Eigenface 1 (largest λ):  overall lighting variation (biggest source of variance)
Eigenface 2:              left-right illumination or gender-related shape
Eigenface 3–5:            identity-specific shape variations (forehead, eye spacing)
Eigenface k (small λ):   subtle fine-grained variation — mostly noise beyond a point
```

Visually, eigenfaces look like **eerie ghost-like face images** — shadow patterns, half-faces. Each represents one "axis of variation" in face space.

---

**A (Why "Eigen"?):**

**Eigen** is German for "own / characteristic." Eigenvectors are the characteristic directions of the covariance matrix — the axes along which data naturally varies most.

```
2D analogy — face data cloud forms an ellipse:

    •  •
  •  •  •  •          v1 ──────→  (longest axis = eigenface 1)
    •  •  •  •         ↑
      •  •             v2 (second longest axis = eigenface 2)
```

In 10,000-D, PCA finds the $k$ directions capturing the most spread.

---

**A (Step 6 — Project & Recognize):**

Project new face $x$ into eigenspace:
$$z = V_k^T (x - \mu)$$
$z$ = $k$-dimensional coordinate vector — "how much of eigenface 1, eigenface 2, ..."

Reconstruct from eigenspace:
$$\hat{x} = \mu + V_k z$$

**Recognition via nearest neighbor:**
```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

pca = PCA(n_components=50)
pca.fit(X_train)                           # X_train: (N, d) flattened faces
Z_train = pca.transform(X_train)           # (N, 50) — faces in eigenspace

z_probe = pca.transform(x_probe.reshape(1, -1))   # (1, 50)
distances = np.linalg.norm(Z_train - z_probe, axis=1)
identity = np.argmin(distances)
```

---

**A (Eigenvalue = Variance Explained):**

$$\text{Variance explained by component } i = \frac{\lambda_i}{\sum_j \lambda_j}$$

```
λ1 = 5000  → 50% of all face variation
λ2 = 2000  → 20%
λ3 = 1000  → 10%
...
Top 50 eigenfaces → typically ~95% of total variance
```

This is why $k = 50$–$200$ is sufficient — the face subspace is genuinely low-dimensional.

---

**A (Why PCA Works and Why It Fails):**

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Works** | Faces lie in a low-dim subspace; PCA finds the most efficient basis for it |
| **Works** | Massive dimensionality reduction: 10,000 → 50–200, fast matching |
| **Fails — illumination** | Eigenface 1 often captures lighting, not identity — most variance in face images is due to lighting |
| **Fails — pose** | Profile face projects to completely different location in frontal-trained eigenspace |
| **Fails — not discriminative** | PCA maximizes **total variance**, not **identity-discriminative variance** — no class label awareness |
| **Fails — holistic** | One corrupted region (occlusion, glasses) corrupts the entire feature vector |

**Fixes:**
- **Fisherfaces (LDA)**: maximize between-class / within-class variance → discriminative
- **Deep CNNs**: nonlinear features that are inherently discriminative and deformation-invariant

---

**Punchline for interviews:**
> Eigenfaces are the top-k eigenvectors of the face image covariance matrix — they form an orthogonal basis for the subspace of maximum variance in face space. Each face is represented as a linear combination of these basis images (its projection coordinates), enabling recognition via nearest-neighbor in this compact low-dimensional space. PCA is unsupervised and maximizes total variance, not class discriminability — which is its key limitation compared to LDA-based (Fisherfaces) or deep learning approaches.

---

### Q: "Faces don't occupy the entire space randomly — they cluster in a small subspace because all faces share similar structure." Explain this.

---

Think of all possible 100×100 pixel images — that's 10,000 dimensions. A **random image** in that space looks like TV static. Any combination of pixel values is valid.

But a **face image** is not random. It is heavily constrained:

- Eyes are always in the upper half
- Nose is always between eyes and mouth
- Skin pixels are spatially continuous — a cheek pixel and its neighbor are highly correlated
- Left and right eyes always appear roughly symmetrical
- Dark eyebrow pixels always appear just above bright eye-white pixels

These **structural constraints** mean that if you know ~50 numbers (how wide is this face? how deep-set are the eyes? how prominent is the nose?), you can reconstruct a recognizable approximation. You do **not** need all 10,000 pixel values independently.

In math terms:
$$\text{Face} \approx \mu + w_1 v_1 + w_2 v_2 + \cdots + w_k v_k \quad (k \ll d)$$

The face lives near a **$k$-dimensional "sheet"** (subspace) embedded inside the 10,000-D space.

**Analogy**: Human heights and weights span a 2D plane in a potentially infinite space of body measurements — because they are biologically correlated. Faces are the same — millions of pixels, but tightly correlated by anatomy.

---

### Q: Fisherfaces (LDA-based) — "More discriminative than PCA Eigenfaces." Explain this.

---

**A (The Core Problem with PCA):**

PCA asks: **"What directions capture the most variance overall?"** — completely unsupervised, no concept of identity labels.

Result: top directions are dominated by **lighting and background**, not identity.

```
PCA finds:
  Eigenface 1 → "faces vary most in overall brightness"     ← NOT identity
  Eigenface 2 → "faces vary most in left-right lighting"    ← NOT identity

LDA asks instead:
  "What directions best SEPARATE different people from each other?"
```

---

**A (The LDA Objective — Fisher Criterion):**

LDA is supervised — it knows the class labels (person IDs). It finds projection $W$ maximizing:

$$J(W) = \frac{W^T S_B W}{W^T S_W W}$$

- $S_B$ = **Between-class scatter** — how spread out class means are from global mean → maximize
- $S_W$ = **Within-class scatter** — how spread out samples are within each class → minimize

**Within-class scatter** (variation *inside* each person's images):
$$S_W = \sum_{i=1}^{c} \sum_{x \in \text{class}_i} (x - \mu_i)(x - \mu_i)^T$$

**Between-class scatter** (variation *between* different people's mean faces):
$$S_B = \sum_{i=1}^{c} n_i (\mu_i - \mu)(\mu_i - \mu)^T$$

---

**A (Visual Intuition):**

```
PCA projection (maximizes total variance):

  Person A: •  •                Person B: •  •
                  •    •   •  •
  ←─────── lots of overlap — same lighting clusters together ──→

LDA projection (maximizes between/within ratio):

  Person A: •••        Person B: •••        Person C: •••
  ←──── well separated, tight clusters per identity ──────────→
```

---

**A (Why PCA First? The Singularity Problem):**

$S_W$ is $d \times d$ (e.g., 10,000 × 10,000). With $N < d$ training images (almost always), $S_W$ is **singular** — non-invertible.

**Fisherfaces fix (Belhumeur et al. 1997)**:
```
Raw face (d = 10,000)
   ↓  PCA → reduce to N - c dimensions  (makes S_W non-singular)
Reduced face (~300-dim)
   ↓  LDA → keep c - 1 dimensions
Fisher embedding (c-1 dim)  ← maximally discriminative, very compact
```

Final dimensionality = at most $c - 1$ (number of classes minus 1).

---

**A (Concrete Example — Illumination Variation):**

```
3 people × 3 lighting conditions = 9 images

PCA (no labels):
  → finds lighting direction as top component
  → all "dim" images cluster together regardless of identity ✗

LDA (with labels A, B, C):
  → finds direction separating A from B from C
  → all images of Person A cluster together ✓
  → A, B, C well separated ✓
```

This is the classic Fisherfaces result — under varying illumination, LDA dramatically outperforms PCA.

---

**A (PCA vs LDA Trade-offs):**

| Scenario | PCA | LDA |
|----------|-----|-----|
| Illumination variation | Poor | Good (suppresses lighting) |
| Limited training data | Stable | Overfits (S_W poorly estimated) |
| Many classes, few samples | OK | S_W poorly conditioned |
| Nonlinear class boundaries | Poor | Poor (both are linear) |
| Large pose variation | Poor | Still poor |

Both are **linear** methods — they fail when class boundaries in pixel space are nonlinear (large pose, expression). Deep learning solves this with nonlinear projections.

---

**A (Conceptual Lineage — LDA → ArcFace):**

```
LDA (1997)                   ArcFace (2019)
─────────────────────────    ────────────────────────────────
Linear projection            Nonlinear deep CNN projection
Minimize S_W                 Intra-class compactness
Maximize S_B                 Inter-class angular margin
Closed-form solution         SGD optimization
Operates on raw pixels       Operates on deep embeddings
At most c-1 dimensions       512-dim unit hypersphere
```

ArcFace is the **deep nonlinear generalization of LDA's discriminative philosophy** — applied at the embedding level instead of pixel level.

---

**Punchline for interviews:**
> Fisherfaces applies LDA on top of PCA: PCA first reduces dimensionality to make $S_W$ invertible, then LDA finds the $c-1$ projection directions that maximize between-class scatter relative to within-class scatter — explicitly encoding "same person close, different people far." This makes it far more robust to illumination variation than Eigenfaces, which blindly maximizes total variance and ends up encoding lighting rather than identity in its top components.

---

### Q: SIFT/SURF for Faces — Scale + rotation invariant keypoint descriptors. Explain this.

---

**A (What Problem Are They Solving?):**

Before deep learning, the challenge was: how do you describe a face patch in a way that doesn't change when the image is **scaled or rotated**?

A close-up eye patch vs a distant eye patch look completely different in raw pixels — different size, different angle. SIFT says "this is the same eye" regardless. That's scale + rotation invariance.

---

**A (Part 1 — Keypoint Detection via Difference of Gaussians):**

SIFT builds a **scale-space pyramid** by blurring at progressively larger scales:

```
Original → Gaussian blur (σ=1.0) → L1
         → Gaussian blur (σ=1.4) → L2
         → Gaussian blur (σ=2.0) → L3

DoG = L(k+1) - L(k)   ← approximates Laplacian of Gaussian (blob detector)
```

A keypoint is a **3D local extremum** in (x, y, scale) space — stable in both position and scale. Additional filters remove:
- Low contrast responses (noise)
- Edge responses (poorly localized) — via Hessian matrix ratio test

DoG fires naturally at facial landmark regions: eye corners, nose tip, lip corners — precisely because these are high-contrast, corner-like, blob-like structures.

---

**A (Part 2 — Rotation Invariance via Dominant Orientation):**

For each detected keypoint at scale $\sigma^*$:
1. Compute gradient directions in surrounding region
2. Build 36-bin orientation histogram (0°–360°)
3. Dominant peak = keypoint's **canonical orientation**
4. All description is done relative to this orientation

```
Head tilted 15°: dominant orientation = 15° → descriptor computed at -15° offset → same result as upright
Head upright:    dominant orientation = 0°  → descriptor computed at 0°
Both → identical descriptor ✓
```

---

**A (Part 3 — The 128-Dimensional Descriptor):**

Around the keypoint (aligned to canonical scale + orientation):
1. Take 16×16 pixel region
2. Divide into 4×4 grid of cells (each 4×4 px)
3. Per cell: 8-bin gradient orientation histogram
4. Concatenate: 4 × 4 × 8 = **128 numbers**
5. L2-normalize → robust to illumination changes

```
16×16 region:
┌────┬────┬────┬────┐
│ 8  │ 8  │ 8  │ 8  │  ← each box = 4×4 pixels = 8-bin histogram
├────┼────┼────┼────┤
│ 8  │ 8  │ 8  │ 8  │
├────┼────┼────┼────┤
│ 8  │ 8  │ 8  │ 8  │
├────┼────┼────┼────┤
│ 8  │ 8  │ 8  │ 8  │
└────┴────┴────┴────┘
Total: 4×4×8 = 128-dim
```

---

**A (Part 4 — SIFT for Face Recognition Pipeline):**

```
Detect face → run SIFT → get N keypoints (e.g., 50–500)
   ↓
128-dim descriptor per keypoint
   ↓
Match keypoints between probe and gallery (nearest-neighbor in 128-D)
   ↓
RANSAC → reject outlier matches → count inliers
   ↓
High inlier count → same person
```

---

**A (SURF — Faster Approximation):**

| | SIFT | SURF |
|--|------|------|
| Detector | DoG (Difference of Gaussians) | Fast Hessian (box filter via integral image) |
| Descriptor | 128-dim gradient histograms | 64-dim Haar wavelet responses |
| Speed | Baseline | ~3–7× faster |
| Accuracy | Slightly better | Slightly worse |

SURF uses **integral images** to compute box filter approximations of the Hessian in O(1) — same trick as Viola-Jones.

---

**A (Why Deep Features Superseded SIFT/SURF):**

| | SIFT/SURF | Deep CNN Embedding |
|--|-----------|-------------------|
| Invariance | Scale + rotation only | Scale, rotation, illumination, expression, pose, aging |
| Identity discrimination | Not trained for it | Explicitly optimized (ArcFace, CosFace) |
| Descriptor | 128-dim per local keypoint | 512-dim global embedding for whole face |
| Aggregation | Needed (Bag of Words, VLAD) | Single forward pass |
| LFW accuracy | ~60–70% | ~99.8% |

**Fundamental limitation**: SIFT describes a **local patch** with no understanding of global face structure. Two different people can have nearly identical SIFT descriptors at their eye corners. Deep embeddings encode **holistic identity** — the full spatial relationship of all features together.

---

**Punchline for interviews:**
> SIFT detects keypoints at scale-space extrema of DoG, normalizes for dominant orientation, then builds a 128-dim histogram-of-gradients descriptor — invariant to scale and rotation. For faces it fires naturally at landmark regions. It was meaningful for face matching but fundamentally limited by being local and non-discriminative by design — deep embeddings replaced it by learning global, identity-optimized representations directly from labeled face data.

---

### Q: Receptive Field Growth — $RF_l = RF_{l-1} + (k_l - 1) \times \prod_{i=1}^{l-1} s_i$ — Explain this.

---

**A (Basic — What is a Receptive Field?):**

A **receptive field** is the region of the **original input image** that a single neuron can "see" — the set of input pixels that influenced that neuron's activation.

```
Input image (7×7):         Layer 1 neuron:        Layer 2 neuron:
                           sees 3×3 patch          sees 5×5 patch
┌─────────────┐            ┌───┐                   ┌─────┐
│ . . . . . . │            │ . │ ← RF=3×3          │ . . │ ← RF=5×5
│ . . . . . . │            │ . │                   │ . . │
│ . . . . . . │            └───┘                   └─────┘
│ . . . . . . │
└─────────────┘
```

Each layer deeper, each neuron looks at a wider region of the original image. This is **receptive field growth**.

---

**A (Formula Breakdown):**

$$RF_l = RF_{l-1} + (k_l - 1) \times \prod_{i=1}^{l-1} s_i$$

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| $RF_l$ | Receptive field size at layer $l$ |
| $RF_{l-1}$ | RF from all previous layers |
| $k_l$ | Kernel size at layer $l$ (e.g., 3×3 → $k=3$) |
| $s_i$ | Stride at layer $i$ |
| $\prod_{i=1}^{l-1} s_i$ | Cumulative stride — total spatial downsampling up to layer $l-1$ |

**In plain English**: each new layer adds $(k_l - 1)$ new pixels to the RF in original image space, scaled by how much the feature map has already been downsampled (cumulative stride).

---

**A (Step-by-Step Walkthrough):**

Network: 3×3 kernels, stride 1 except layer 2 (stride 2):

```
Layer 0 (input):  RF = 1
Layer 1:  k=3, s=1  →  RF = 1 + (3-1)×1 = 3
Layer 2:  k=3, s=2  →  RF = 3 + (3-1)×1 = 5
Layer 3:  k=3, s=1  →  RF = 5 + (3-1)×(1×2) = 9
```

The stride-2 at layer 2 doubles the RF growth rate for all subsequent layers.

---

**A (Why Cumulative Stride Matters):**

When a layer has stride 2, every "step" in the next layer corresponds to **2 steps** in the original image. So any kernel expansion there expands the RF twice as much.

```
Without stride (all s=1), 10 layers of 3×3:
  RF = 1 + 10×(3-1)×1 = 21  ← only 21×21 covered

With stride-2 at layer 5:
  Each subsequent 3×3 adds 4 pixels to RF instead of 2
  → RF covers much more of the original image
```

---

**A (Real ResNet-50 — 112×112 face input):**

```
Layer               k    s    Cumul. stride    RF
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
Input               -    -    1                1

Res Block 3 (3×3,s2)3    2    4                35
Res Block 4 (3×3)   3    1    8                51
Res Block 5 (3×3)   3    1    8                67
Res Block 6 (3×3,s2)3    2    8                83
Res Block 7 (3×3)   3    1    16               115
...deep layers...                              > 112 (entire face)
```

By the deep residual blocks, every neuron's RF covers the **entire 112×112 face**.

---

**A (Theoretical vs Effective RF):**

| | Theoretical RF | Effective RF |
|--|---------------|-------------|
| Definition | Max region that *could* influence a neuron | Region that *actually* contributes meaningfully |
| Shape | Uniform square | Gaussian — center dominates, edges decay |
| Growth rate | $O(l)$ with depth | $O(\sqrt{l})$ — slower |

Center pixels contribute exponentially more than border pixels — which is why very deep networks and strides are needed to make the effective RF actually cover the whole face.

---

**A (Why This Matters for Face Recognition):**

| RF Size | What a Neuron Can Reason About |
|---------|-------------------------------|
| RF = 3×3 | Single edge direction |
| RF = 15×15 | Eye socket shape |
| RF = 35×35 | Inter-ocular distance |
| RF = 80×80 | Half-face feature relationships |
| RF = 112×112 | Entire face — identity |

Identity = global spatial relationships (jaw width vs forehead, eye spacing, nose bridge). Only neurons with RF covering the full face can encode this — which is why only **deep layers** are discriminative for recognition.

---

**Punchline for interviews:**
> The RF grows with each layer by $(k_l - 1)$ pixels in original image coordinates, scaled by cumulative stride — because each downsampling step makes every subsequent kernel step correspond to more original pixels. Deep layers in face networks have RFs covering the entire face, enabling neurons to capture global structural relationships that encode identity — which is why only deep features are discriminative for recognition.

---

### Q: Followup — Explain the diagram: "Layer 1 sees 3×3, Layer 2 sees 5×5 patch."

---

**A (The Diagram Shows the Same Neuron Traced Back):**

The diagram asks: *"which pixels in the original image contributed to this one output neuron?"*

**Layer 1 Neuron — RF = 3×3:**

A 3×3 conv filter produces one output neuron from exactly 9 input pixels:

```
Input image (7×7):
┌───────────────┐
│ . . . . . . . │
│ . ■ ■ ■ . . . │  ← these 9 pixels feed into ONE Layer 1 neuron
│ . ■ ■ ■ . . . │
│ . ■ ■ ■ . . . │
│ . . . . . . . │
└───────────────┘
  Layer 1 neuron = f(those 9 pixels) → detects local edge/texture
```

**Layer 2 Neuron — RF = 5×5:**

Layer 2 applies another 3×3 filter over Layer 1's output. Each Layer 2 neuron connects to a 3×3 block of Layer 1 neurons. Each of those Layer 1 neurons already saw 3×3 of the original. The combined coverage = 5×5:

```
Input image (7×7):
┌───────────────┐
│ . ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ . │  ← 25 pixels collectively influence ONE Layer 2 neuron
│ . ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ . │
│ . ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ . │
│ . ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ . │
│ . ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ . │
│ . . . . . . . │
└───────────────┘
  Layer 2 neuron = f(25 pixels) → detects broader pattern
```

**Why +2 per layer (3×3 kernel, stride 1)?**
Each new 3×3 layer adds 1 pixel on each side of the existing RF:
```
RF = 3 → 5 → 7 → 9 → 11 ...
      +2   +2   +2   +2
```
Growth per layer = $k - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2$ pixels (1 on each side).

---

**A (The Key Insight — Why This Builds Identity Understanding):**

```
Layer 1  RF=3×3:   "I see a horizontal edge"           → too local
Layer 2  RF=5×5:   "I see a curve pattern"             → maybe an eyelash
Layer 20 RF=40×40: "I see an eye-shaped structure"     → facial part
Layer 50 RF=112×112:"I see the full face geometry"     → IDENTITY
```

The diagram illustrates the **fundamental mechanism** by which CNNs go from pixels → edges → parts → identity — progressive, layer-by-layer expansion of what each neuron can "see."

---

### Q: ResNet-50/100 is the de-facto backbone for face recognition (ArcFace, CosFace). Explain why.

---

**A (Basic — What is a Backbone?):**

The **backbone** is the main feature extractor — the CNN that takes a raw image and produces a rich feature vector. Everything else (loss function, classifier head) is built on top of it.

```
Input face (112×112)
       ↓
  [ BACKBONE ]  ← ResNet-50/100
       ↓
  Feature vector (2048-dim)
       ↓
  FC layer → 512-dim embedding
       ↓
  ArcFace loss head
```

---

**A (The Problem ResNet Solved — Vanishing Gradients):**

Before ResNet, training networks deeper than ~20 layers failed. Gradients shrink multiplicatively during backprop:

$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial W_1} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial W_N} \times \frac{\partial W_N}{\partial W_{N-1}} \times \cdots \times \frac{\partial W_2}{\partial W_1}$$

Each term < 1 → multiplied 50+ times → gradient ≈ 0 at early layers → early layers never learn.

Result: a 56-layer plain CNN performed **worse** than a 20-layer one (He et al. 2015).

**A (The ResNet Solution — Skip Connections):**

$$y = F(x, \{W_i\}) + x$$

The network learns the **residual** $F(x) = H(x) - x$ instead of the full mapping.

```
Standard block:               Residual (IR) block (InsightFace):

x → Conv → BN → ReLU          x ──────────────────────┐
  → Conv → BN        → y        ↓                      │ skip
                               BN → Conv → BN → PReLU  │
                               → Conv → BN              │
                                   ↓         +──────────┘
                                   y
```

Gradient through skip: $\frac{\partial L}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial y}\left(1 + \frac{\partial F}{\partial x}\right)$ — the "1" guarantees gradient never vanishes.

**A (InsightFace IR Block — Modifications for Faces):**

| | Standard ResNet Block | IR Block (InsightFace) |
|--|----------------------|----------------------|
| Order | Conv → BN → ReLU | **BN → Conv → BN → PReLU** |
| Activation | ReLU (fixed zero for negatives) | **PReLU** (learnable slope α ≈ 0.25) |
| After addition | ReLU | **None** — preserves identity |

PReLU: $f(x) = \max(\alpha x, x)$, $\alpha$ learned — empirically +0.1–0.3% on LFW vs ReLU.

---

**A (Why ResNet-50/100 Specifically — Not Shallower, Not Deeper?):**

```
ResNet-18:   ~11M params  → insufficient depth/capacity → 99.4% LFW
ResNet-50:   ~25M params  → sweet spot speed/accuracy  → 99.7% LFW  ✓
ResNet-100:  ~42M params  → maximum accuracy           → 99.8% LFW  ✓
ResNet-152:  ~60M params  → diminishing returns, 2× cost for <0.1% gain
```

| | ResNet-50 | ResNet-100 |
|--|-----------|-----------|
| GFLOPs (112×112) | ~4 | ~12 |
| Best for | Production, real-time | Server-side, max accuracy |

---

**A (What Happens Inside ResNet-50 for a Face):**

```
Input: 112×112×3
  ↓ Conv1 (7×7, s=2) + MaxPool (s=2)
64×64×64
  ↓ Stage 1: 3× IR blocks, 64ch      → RF ~35×35  (nose region)
  ↓ Stage 2: 4× IR blocks, 128ch, s2 → RF ~67×67  (half face)
  ↓ Stage 3: 14× IR blocks, 256ch, s2 → RF > 112  (entire face)
  ↓ Stage 4: 3× IR blocks, 512ch, s2
7×7×512
  ↓ BN → Dropout(0.4) → Flatten → FC(512) → BN
512-dim L2-normalized embedding
```

Stage 3 with **14 residual blocks** is where most identity learning happens — enough capacity to disentangle 100K+ identities.

---

**A (Why ResNet Won Over Alternatives):**

| Backbone | Pros | Cons | Face Use |
|---------|------|------|----------|
| VGG-16/19 | Simple | No skip connections, slow | Outdated |
| **ResNet-50/100** | Deep, efficient, stable | Fixed architecture | **De-facto standard** |
| MobileNetV2/V3 | Tiny, fast | Lower accuracy | Mobile/edge |
| EfficientNet | Best param efficiency | Harder to train for faces | Some production |
| ViT / Swin | Global attention | Needs massive data, slower | Research |

ResNet won because: skip connections → depth without vanishing gradients; bottleneck blocks → compute efficiency; IR modification → face-specific tuning; proven stable at scale (MS-Celeb 10M, WebFace 260M images).

---

**Punchline for interviews:**
> ResNet-50/100 dominates face recognition because residual skip connections solve the vanishing gradient problem — enabling 50–100 layer depth needed for full-face receptive fields and capacity to separate 100K+ identities. InsightFace's IR modification (pre-BN + PReLU + no post-addition ReLU) further optimizes the block for face-specific training. ResNet-50 hits the sweet spot of accuracy vs speed; ResNet-100 is used when maximum accuracy is required and inference cost is secondary.

### Q: Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SE-Net) — "Recalibrate channel-wise feature responses." Explain this.

---

**A (Basic — The Problem SE-Net Solves):**

A standard CNN treats **all channels equally** after a convolution. But not all channels are equally useful for a given input:

```
Channel 42 → detects eye textures        → very useful for identity
Channel 87 → detects background patterns → completely irrelevant
Channel 15 → detects skin gradients      → moderately useful
```

Standard CNN: weights all 512 channels equally.
SE-Net: looks at the image first, then **dynamically amplifies useful channels and suppresses irrelevant ones**.

---

**A (The Two Steps — Squeeze + Excitation):**

**Step 1: SQUEEZE** — $z_c = \frac{1}{H \times W} \sum_{i,j} u_c(i,j)$

Compress each channel's entire H×W feature map into **one number** (Global Average Pooling):

```
Feature map: (C, H, W)

Channel 1: [[0.2, 0.8], [0.5, 0.3]]  → avg → 0.45  (moderate activity)
Channel 2: [[0.9, 0.8], [0.7, 0.9]]  → avg → 0.83  (high activity)
Channel 3: [[0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.1]]  → avg → 0.03  (near-silent)

Squeeze output z: [0.45, 0.83, 0.03, ...]  shape = (C,)
```

$z_c$ = "how active was this channel overall?" → a summary of each channel's relevance.

**Step 2: EXCITATION** — $s = \sigma(W_2 \cdot \delta(W_1 z))$

A small 2-layer FC network learns which channels to amplify/suppress:

```
z  (C)
 ↓ W1: FC [C → C/r]   (r=16, reduction bottleneck)
 ↓ δ = ReLU
 ↓ W2: FC [C/r → C]
 ↓ σ = Sigmoid
s  (C)  ← per-channel weights in [0, 1]
```

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| $W_1, W_2$ | Learned FC weights |
| $\delta$ | ReLU — learns non-linear channel interactions |
| $\sigma$ | Sigmoid — outputs attention in [0,1] |
| $s_c$ | How much to keep channel $c$ |

The bottleneck $C \to C/r \to C$ forces the network to learn **compressed inter-channel dependencies** with minimal parameters: $2 \times C^2/r$ params (e.g., C=256, r=16 → only 8,192 params).

**Step 3: SCALE** — $\tilde{x}_c = s_c \cdot u_c$

Multiply each channel's feature map by its scalar attention weight:

```
s = [0.9, 0.1, 0.8, 0.05, ...]
     ↑    ↑    ↑    ↑
  eye   bg   id   noise
  ×0.9  ×0.1 ×0.8 ×0.05   ← spatial maps unchanged, only importance scaled
```

SE is a **plug-in module** — inserts into any architecture (ResNet, VGG, Inception) with minimal overhead.

---

**A (What SE-Net Learns for Faces):**

```
Frontal, well-lit face:
  s ≈ [1.0, 0.9, 0.1, 0.8, ...]
       identity  texture  lighting  (noise suppressed)

Profile face:
  s ≈ [0.3, 0.7, 0.9, 0.5, ...]
       frontal   profile  silhouette  (frontal channels suppressed)
       (suppressed) features
```

The network dynamically re-weights channels based on each specific input — more robust to pose and condition variation.

---

**A (Why GAP for Squeeze?):**

Global Average Pooling is chosen because:
- Aggregates **global spatial context** across the whole face (not just one region)
- Differentiable → clean gradient flow
- Permutation invariant to spatial position
- Proven to capture semantic content (used in GoogLeNet classification)

Max pooling alternative: captures only peak activation, misses overall channel distribution.

---

**A (Parameter Overhead — Why It's Cheap):**

```
SE params for C=256, r=16:  2 × (256²/16) = 8,192
ResNet-50 total params:     ~25M
SE overhead:                ~2.5M  (~10%)
Accuracy gain on LFW:       +0.03–0.1%
Accuracy gain on IJB-B/C:   +0.3–0.5% (harder benchmark, more gain)
```

SE-Net won **ILSVRC 2017** — last year of the competition — by squeezing extra performance from existing architectures with minimal cost.

**Empirical results (ArcFace paper)**:
- ResNet-50 ArcFace: 99.77% LFW
- **SE-ResNet-50 ArcFace: 99.80% LFW** (+0.03%)
- Larger gains on IJB-B/C where dynamic channel selection matters more

---

**Punchline for interviews:**
> SE-Net adds lightweight channel attention: Squeeze compresses each channel's H×W map into a scalar via GAP; Excitation passes that vector through a bottleneck FC network (C→C/r→C + sigmoid) to produce per-channel weights in [0,1]; Scale multiplies each channel by its weight. The network learns which feature channels are relevant for each specific input — dynamically amplifying identity-relevant channels and suppressing noise — with only ~10% parameter overhead and consistent accuracy gains.

### Q: Depthwise Separable Convolutions — $D_k^2 \cdot M \cdot N$ → $D_k^2 \cdot M + M \cdot N$ → ~8–9× fewer ops. Explain this.

---

**A (Basic — Why This Exists):**

Standard convolutions are too expensive for mobile/edge face recognition. A ResNet-50 costs ~4 GFLOPs per 112×112 face — unacceptable at real-time on a phone. Depthwise Separable Convolution **factorizes** a standard conv into two cheaper steps that approximate the same result with ~8–9× less computation.

---

**A (What a Standard Conv Does):**

A standard conv filter shape: $(D_k \times D_k \times M)$ — operates on all $M$ input channels + $D_k \times D_k$ spatial neighborhood simultaneously, producing 1 output channel. $N$ filters → $N$ output channels.

$$\text{Cost} = D_k^2 \times M \times N \times H \times W$$

It does two things at once: **spatial filtering** (neighborhood) + **channel mixing** (across M channels).

---

**A (The Factorization — Two Separate Steps):**

**Step 1: Depthwise Conv — spatial filtering only**

One separate $D_k \times D_k$ filter per channel, no cross-channel mixing:

```
Channel 1  →  [3×3 filter_1]  →  out_1
Channel 2  →  [3×3 filter_2]  →  out_2     M in → M out
Channel M  →  [3×3 filter_M]  →  out_M
```

Cost: $D_k^2 \times M \times H \times W$

**Step 2: Pointwise Conv — channel mixing only**

1×1 convolutions: weighted sum across all M channels at each spatial position:

```
[out_1, out_2, ..., out_M]  →  [1×1×M filter_1]  →  ch_1
                             →  [1×1×M filter_2]  →  ch_2   M → N channels
                             →  [1×1×M filter_N]  →  ch_N
```

Cost: $M \times N \times H \times W$

---

**A (Cost Comparison):**

| Operation | Multiplications |
|-----------|----------------|
| Standard Conv | $D_k^2 \cdot M \cdot N$ |
| Depthwise | $D_k^2 \cdot M$ |
| Pointwise | $M \cdot N$ |
| **Depthwise + Pointwise** | $D_k^2 \cdot M + M \cdot N$ |

**Reduction ratio:**
$$\frac{D_k^2 \cdot M + M \cdot N}{D_k^2 \cdot M \cdot N} = \frac{1}{N} + \frac{1}{D_k^2}$$

For $D_k=3$, $N=256$: $\frac{1}{256} + \frac{1}{9} \approx \frac{1}{8.6}$ → **~8–9× fewer operations**.

---

**A (Visual Breakdown — Small Example):**

```
Standard Conv (3×3, M=3 input ch, N=4 output ch):
  Cost per position: 3×3 × 3 × 4 = 108 multiplications

Depthwise (3×3, M=3):
  Cost per position: 3×3 × 3 = 27

Pointwise (1×1, M=3 → N=4):
  Cost per position: 3 × 4 = 12

Total: 27 + 12 = 39  vs  108  →  2.8× here
(ratio grows with larger N — at N=256, reaches ~8–9×)
```

---

**A (MobileFaceNet — Applied to Face Recognition):**

```
112×112×3
  ↓ Conv 3×3, s=2, 64ch
  ↓ 5× Bottleneck blocks (inverted residuals, depthwise sep)
7×7×512
  ↓ GDC (Global Depthwise Conv 7×7)  ← preserves face spatial structure
1×1×512
  ↓ FC → 128-dim → BN
128-dim L2-normalized embedding
```

**Results vs ResNet-50:**

| | ResNet-50 (ArcFace) | MobileFaceNet |
|--|--------------------|--------------------|
| Parameters | ~25M | ~1M |
| GFLOPs | ~4.0 | ~0.22 |
| LFW accuracy | 99.77% | 99.55% |
| Mobile CPU inference | ~200ms | ~20ms |
| Use case | Server / max accuracy | Mobile / edge / real-time |

**25× fewer parameters, 18× fewer FLOPs, only ~0.2% accuracy loss** — acceptable for mobile deployment.

---

**A (Why the Approximation Works):**

1. Spatial patterns and channel combinations are **somewhat independent** in practice
2. Pointwise conv recovers **full expressivity** — any linear combination of channels is achievable
3. BN + nonlinearity **between** the two steps compensates for approximation error
4. Savings allow **wider layers** (more channels) which partially compensates expressivity loss

---

**Punchline for interviews:**
> Depthwise separable conv factorizes a standard $D_k^2 \cdot M \cdot N$ conv into depthwise (spatial filtering per channel: $D_k^2 \cdot M$) + pointwise (channel mixing: $M \cdot N$), achieving ~8–9× fewer operations for $D_k=3$. MobileFaceNet applies this to face recognition — 99.55% LFW accuracy with only ~1M parameters and 0.22 GFLOPs, making real-time face recognition feasible on mobile CPUs with ~0.2% accuracy trade-off vs ResNet-50.

---

### Q: Vision Transformer (ViT) for Faces — Patch tokens, Multi-head self-attention, FaceTransformer, TransFace. Explain this.

---

**A (Basic — Why Transformers for Faces?):**

CNNs build global understanding gradually through many layers. Transformers ask: **"Why not let every patch directly attend to every other patch from layer one?"**

A face has rich **global structure** — the relationship between eye spacing and jaw width is just as important as local texture. ViT captures this directly via self-attention.

---

**A (Step 1 — Patch Tokenization):**

Divide 112×112 face into 8×8 patches: $(112/8) \times (112/8) = 14 \times 14 = 196$ patches.

```
┌──┬──┬──┬──┬──┬──┬──┬──┬──┬──┬──┬──┬──┬──┐

└──┴──┴──┴──┴──┴──┴──┴──┴──┴──┴──┴──┴──┴──┘
196 patches total
```

Each patch (8×8×3 = 192 values) → linear projection → **D-dim token** (e.g., D=512).

Add **positional embeddings** so the model knows spatial location of each patch:
```
Token_i = Patch_embedding_i + Positional_embedding_i
```
Without this, the transformer can't distinguish left eye from right eye patch.

---

**A (Step 2 — Multi-Head Self-Attention):**

For each token $x_i$, compute Query, Key, Value:
$$Q_i = W_Q x_i, \quad K_i = W_K x_i, \quad V_i = W_V x_i$$

Attention score between patch $i$ and $j$:
$$a_{ij} = \frac{Q_i \cdot K_j}{\sqrt{d_k}}$$

Attention weights (softmax):
$$\alpha_{ij} = \frac{\exp(a_{ij})}{\sum_k \exp(a_{ik})}$$

Output for token $i$:
$$z_i = \sum_j \alpha_{ij} V_j$$

**What this means for a face:**
```
Left eye patch attends to:
  Right eye patch   → α = 0.35  (high: inter-ocular distance = identity cue)
  Nose bridge       → α = 0.20  (moderate: positional geometry)
  Cheek patch       → α = 0.15  (moderate: skin texture context)
  Background patch  → α = 0.01  (very low: irrelevant)
```
This is computed **in one layer, directly** — no need to propagate through 20 CNN layers.

**Multi-head**: run $h$ attention heads in parallel, each learning different relationships:
```
Head 1 → spatial geometry (eye-to-eye distance)
Head 2 → texture similarity (matching skin patches)
Head 3 → symmetry (left-right face correspondence)
Head 4 → semantic parts (all "eye" patches together)
```
$$\text{MultiHead}(Q,K,V) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, ..., \text{head}_h) W_O$$

---

**A (Step 3 — Transformer Encoder Block):**

```
Input tokens (196 × D)
   ↓ LayerNorm
   ↓ Multi-Head Self-Attention
   ↓ + residual
   ↓ LayerNorm
   ↓ MLP (D → 4D → D, GELU)
   ↓ + residual
Output tokens (196 × D)
```

Stack $L$ blocks (L=12 for ViT-Base). Unlike CNN, **every block has global receptive field** — no gradual growth.

**Embedding head**: prepend a learnable `[CLS]` token → after L blocks, take [CLS] output as 512-dim face embedding → L2 normalize → ArcFace loss.

---

**A (Face-Specific ViT Architectures):**

| Model | Key Innovation | LFW | Notes |
|-------|---------------|-----|-------|
| **FaceTransformer** | Pure ViT-B with ArcFace | 99.75% | Needs 10× more data than ResNet-50 to match |
| **TransFace** | Patch masking augmentation + relative pos bias | 99.81% | Forces robust non-positional identity features |
| **Swin Transformer** | Hierarchical local window attention | ~99.78% | More efficient; better for dense prediction |

---

**A (CNN vs ViT for Faces):**

| | CNN (ResNet) | ViT |
|--|-------------|-----|
| Receptive field | Grows gradually | Global from layer 1 |
| Inductive biases | Locality, translation equivariance | None — learned from data |
| Data efficiency | Good (~500K images) | Poor (needs 5M+) |
| Long-range dependencies | Only in deep layers | Every layer |
| Attention cost | O(H×W) | O((HW/p²)²) — quadratic |
| Training stability | Well-understood | Needs careful LR warmup, AdamW |

---

**A (Why Hybrid CNN-ViT is Preferred):**

Pure ViT problems:
1. **Data hunger**: needs >5M images to match ResNet-50 (~500K)
2. **No locality bias**: wastes capacity learning adjacent patches are related
3. **Quadratic cost**: 196 patches → 196² = 38,416 attention pairs per layer

Hybrid solutions:
```
CvT / CoAtNet:  Conv for Q,K,V projections → injects locality + global attention
Swin:           Local window attention + shifted windows for cross-window interaction
CNN stem + ViT: CNN handles early local features, ViT handles global reasoning
```

**CvT** (Conv-ViT): uses depthwise conv for projections → locality bias + global attention → outperforms pure ViT on faces with less data.

---

**A (What Attention Heads Learn for Faces):**

```
Early layers:   attend to local neighborhoods (similar to conv)
Middle layers:  semantic grouping — all "skin" patches attend to each other
Deep layers:    identity geometry — left eye ↔ right eye (symmetry),
                eye patches ↔ nose bridge (inter-feature distances)
[CLS] token:    attends broadly to all face parts equally → global identity
```

---

**Punchline for interviews:**
> ViT divides the face into 196 patch tokens, projects each to D-dim, and applies multi-head self-attention so every patch attends to every other patch from layer one — capturing long-range dependencies like eye-to-jaw geometry that CNNs only access in deep layers. The challenge is data hunger (ViT needs 5M+ images vs ResNet's 500K) due to no inductive biases, which is why hybrid CNN-ViT architectures (CvT, CoAtNet) injecting conv-based locality into the transformer framework are preferred in practice.

---

### Q: Viola-Jones (Haar Cascade, 2001) — Haar features + AdaBoost + Cascade. Explain this.

---

**A (Basic — What Problem It Solves):**

In 2001, real-time face detection was considered nearly impossible. Viola-Jones made it fast enough for 15 fps on a Pentium III by answering: **most of an image is NOT a face — reject non-faces as fast as possible.**

The detector slides a 24×24 window across the image at multiple scales → potentially millions of sub-windows → each must be classified FACE or NOT-FACE as cheaply as possible.

---

**A (Innovation 1 — Haar-like Features + Integral Image):**

Haar-like features are **rectangular difference features** — difference in pixel intensity sums between adjacent rectangles:

```
Type A (horizontal):   Type B (vertical):   Type C (3-rect):
┌──────┬──────┐        ┌──────────┐          ┌────┬────┬────┐
│  +1  │  -1  │        │   +1     │           │ -1 │ +2 │ -1 │
└──────┴──────┘        ├──────────┤           └────┴────┴────┘
                       │   -1     │
                       └──────────┘
```

**Why useful for faces?** Faces have universal intensity structure:
```
BRIGHT  ── forehead ─────────────────
DARK    ── eyebrows ─────────────────
BRIGHT  ── eye whites + nose bridge ─
DARK    ── eye sockets ──────────────
BRIGHT  ── cheeks / midface ─────────
DARK    ── mouth / lips ─────────────
```
Every transition is a Haar feature. The first feature AdaBoost selects: "eye region is darker than cheeks/nose below" — true for virtually every human face.

**Integral image** makes each feature O(1) to compute:
$$I_{int}(x,y) = \sum_{x' \leq x,\ y' \leq y} I(x', y')$$

Rectangle sum = exactly 4 array lookups regardless of size:
```
A───B
│   │   Sum = I(D) - I(B) - I(C) + I(A)
C───D
```

In a 24×24 window: **~160,000 possible Haar features** across all positions, sizes, and types.

---

**A (Innovation 2 — AdaBoost: Selecting the ~200 Best Features):**

Each single Haar feature = a **weak classifier** (slightly better than random):
```
h(x) = FACE     if feature_value < threshold θ
        NON-FACE otherwise
```

AdaBoost training loop:
```
Initialize: equal weights w_i = 1/N for all N training examples

For round t = 1..T:
  1. Find best Haar feature + threshold → weak classifier h_t
  2. Compute weighted error: ε_t = Σ w_i · 1[h_t(x_i) ≠ y_i]
  3. Classifier weight: α_t = ½ ln((1-ε_t)/ε_t)
  4. Update weights:
       misclassified → w_i × e^(+α_t)  (harder examples get more weight)
       correct       → w_i × e^(-α_t)
  5. Normalize weights

Final: H(x) = sign(Σ α_t · h_t(x))
```

**Key**: misclassified examples get higher weight → next classifier focuses on hard cases → ensemble covers all failure modes.

Result: **~200 features selected from 160,000** — the 200 most discriminative.

---

**A (Innovation 3 — Attentional Cascade: Early Rejection):**

Even 200 features per window is too slow for millions of windows. The cascade rejects obvious non-faces immediately:

```
Window enters
  ↓
Stage 1: 2 features   → REJECT ~50% of windows here (very cheap)
  ↓ PASS
Stage 2: 5 features   → REJECT most remaining non-faces
  ↓ PASS
Stage 3: 20 features
  ↓ PASS
...
Stage 38: full features
  ↓ PASS → FACE DETECTED ✓
```

Each stage: **high detection rate (~99.9%), moderate false positive rate (~50%)**
- True face: must pass all stages — probability $(0.999)^{38} \approx 96\%$
- Non-face: probability of surviving all stages = $(0.5)^{38} \approx 4 \times 10^{-12}$

**Average features evaluated per window ≈ 2–10** (not 200) because most windows fail at stage 1.

---

**A (Full Pipeline):**

```
Image → build integral image (O(W×H), once)
  ↓
For each scale × position (millions of windows):
  Stage 1: 2 Haar features via 8 array lookups → REJECT or PASS
  Stage 2: 5 features                          → REJECT or PASS
  ...
  Stage 38                                     → FACE DETECTED
  ↓
NMS: merge overlapping detections across scales
  ↓
Final bounding boxes
```

**A (Limitations):**

| Limitation | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Frontal only | Profile faces need separate cascade |
| Illumination sensitive | Haar = intensity-based; shadows confuse detector |
| No landmark output | Only bounding box |
| ~90% accuracy | MTCNN/RetinaFace achieve 99%+ on unconstrained data |

**Historical significance**: shipped in every Canon camera from 2006. First real-time face detector. Introduced integral image + AdaBoost feature selection + cascade — ideas that influenced detection for a decade.

---

**Punchline for interviews:**
> Viola-Jones achieves real-time detection through three synergistic ideas: integral images enable O(1) Haar feature evaluation; AdaBoost selects ~200 most discriminative features from 160,000 by up-weighting hard examples each round; an attentional cascade rejects ~50% of windows at each stage with just 2–5 features, so the average window costs ~2–10 evaluations rather than 200.

---

### Q: Followup — Haar-like features are "rectangular difference features." Deep explanation.

---

**A (The Fundamental Concept):**

A Haar-like feature asks one question: **"Is this specific region brighter or darker than this adjacent region?"**

```
Two adjacent rectangles:
┌──────────┬──────────┐
│  Region A│  Region B│
│  sum=800 │  sum=200 │
└──────────┴──────────┘
Feature value = 800 - 200 = +600  → "A is much brighter than B"
```

Large positive → A brighter than B. Large negative → A darker. Near zero → similar brightness.

---

**A (Why "Haar-like"?):**

Named after **Haar wavelets** (Alfréd Haar, 1909) — simplest wavelet alternating +1 / -1 regions. Haar-like features are 2D discrete approximations: white region pixels = weight +1, dark region pixels = weight -1.

---

**A (The Four Types — What Each Detects):**

**Type A (horizontal 2-rect)**: left-right transition → vertical edges
```
┌─────────┬─────────┐
│   +1    │   -1    │   sum(left) - sum(right)
└─────────┴─────────┘
Face use: nose shadow vs cheek boundary
```

**Type B (vertical 2-rect)**: top-bottom transition → horizontal edges
```
┌─────────────────┐
│       +1        │   sum(top) - sum(bottom)
├─────────────────┤
│       -1        │
└─────────────────┘
Face use: eyebrow (dark) vs forehead (bright) above it
```

**Type C (3-rect) ← MOST IMPORTANT for faces**:
```
┌──────┬──────┬──────┐
│  -1  │  +2  │  -1  │   center brighter/darker than both sides
└──────┴──────┴──────┘
Face use: nose bridge (bright) between eye sockets (dark)
          → fires on the most universal face intensity pattern
```

**Type D (4-rect diagonal)**:
```
┌──────┬──────┐
│  +1  │  -1  │   diagonal intensity change
├──────┼──────┤
│  -1  │  +1  │
└──────┴──────┘
Face use: diagonal transitions at eye corners, nose bridge slant
```

---

**A (Face Intensity Structure — Why These Features Fire):**

```
Frontal face cross-section (horizontal, through eye level):

        dark     bright    dark
       (eye)   (nose br.) (eye)
        ╲          ↑        ╱
         ╲─────────┼───────╱
                   │
        Type C three-rect fires strongly here
```

The first feature AdaBoost selects is almost always:
```
┌──────────┬──────────┐
│  dark    │  bright  │
│ (eyes)   │(nose/    │
│          │ cheek)   │
└──────────┴──────────┘
"Eye region darker than nose/cheek" — true for virtually every face
```
This single feature rejected ~60% of non-face windows.

---

**A (160,000 Features in a 24×24 Window):**

| Feature Type | Count |
|-------------|-------|
| Type A (horiz 2-rect) | ~43,200 |
| Type B (vert 2-rect) | ~43,200 |
| Type C (3-rect) | ~55,200 |
| Type D (4-rect) | ~20,736 |
| **Total** | **~160,000+** |

All positions × all sizes × 4 types. AdaBoost selects **~200** of these.

---

**A (Feature Value → Weak Classifier):**

Raw feature outputs a continuous value. Thresholded into a binary decision:
```
Feature: sum(eye region) - sum(forehead region)
On face:     -450  (eyes darker ✓)
On car roof: +120  (uniform ✗)
On grass:    +30   (uniform ✗)

Weak classifier: FACE if feature_value < -100, else NON-FACE
```
AdaBoost learns both **which feature** to use AND the **threshold θ** at each round.

---

**Punchline for interviews:**
> Haar-like features are signed differences between adjacent rectangle intensity sums — computed in O(1) via the integral image. They are powerful for faces because faces have universal intensity structure (dark eyes, bright nose bridge, dark eyebrows above bright forehead) that specific Haar features directly encode. AdaBoost finds the ~200 most discriminative from 160,000 candidates, each as a weak threshold classifier on one feature.

---

### Q: The Weak Classifier — 4 components, 60–70% accuracy, how AdaBoost builds strength from weakness.

---

**A (The 4 Components of a Weak Classifier):**

A single Haar feature makes a **weak classifier** with exactly 4 parts:

1. **A single Haar feature** — one rectangular difference (e.g., Type C 3-rect at position (x=4, y=6), width=12, height=4)
2. **A threshold θ** — the learned decision boundary (e.g., θ = -120)
3. **A polarity p** — direction of the inequality (+1 or -1, because sometimes "greater than" is FACE, sometimes "less than")
4. **A classification output** — binary: FACE (1) or NON-FACE (0)

Formally:
$$h_j(x) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } p_j \cdot f_j(x) < p_j \cdot \theta_j \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$

where $f_j(x)$ is the Haar feature value for window $x$.

---

**A (Why "Only Slightly Better Than Random"?):**

Consider the best single feature: *"eye region is darker than nose/cheek"*

```
Faces that pass:    ~85%   (most frontal faces)
Non-faces rejected: ~60%   (many textures accidentally match)
```

A **random coin flip** = 50%. This feature ≈ 60–70%. Weak — but **not useless**.

The reason it's weak:
- Haar features are **axis-aligned rectangles** — they can't model curves, angles, or complex structure
- One feature sees only **one slice** of the face pattern
- Lighting variation, pose change, or background clutter can easily fool any single feature

---

**A (How AdaBoost Builds Strength from Weakness):**

The key insight: **each classifier covers different failure modes.**

```
Round 1:  h₁ = "eyes darker than cheeks"       → gets ~65% right
          misclassified examples get higher weight ↑

Round 2:  h₂ = "nose bridge brighter than eyes" → trained on hard cases h₁ missed
          misclassified examples get higher weight ↑

Round 3:  h₃ = "forehead uniform, eyes dark"    → trained on cases h₁ and h₂ missed
...
Round T:  hₜ learned on whatever remains hard
```

Final strong classifier — **weighted majority vote**:
$$H(x) = \text{sign}\left(\sum_{t=1}^{T} \alpha_t \cdot h_t(x)\right)$$

where $\alpha_t = \frac{1}{2} \ln\!\left(\frac{1 - \varepsilon_t}{\varepsilon_t}\right)$ — better classifiers (lower error $\varepsilon_t$) get higher vote weight.

---

**A (Bias-Variance View):**

| Property | Single Weak Classifier | AdaBoost Ensemble |
|---------|----------------------|------------------|
| Bias | High (too simple) | Low (covers complex patterns) |
| Variance | Low | Controlled (each $h_t$ is simple) |
| Accuracy | 60–70% | 95%+ |

Each $h_t$ is a **depth-1 decision stump** — the simplest possible model. But 200 stumps, each trained on the errors of the previous, collectively partition the 160,000-feature space into a highly non-linear decision boundary that matches the true face distribution.

**The formal guarantee** (Schapire, 1990): training error decreases exponentially with $T$ as long as each weak classifier does better than 50%:

$$\text{Training error} \leq \exp\!\left(-2\sum_{t=1}^{T}\left(\frac{1}{2} - \varepsilon_t\right)^2\right)$$

---

**Punchline for interviews:**
> A weak classifier is a Haar feature + threshold + polarity → binary FACE/NON-FACE. Individually brittle (60–70%), but AdaBoost chains 200 of them so each focuses on what previous ones got wrong, and their weighted vote creates a strong classifier (95%+) — provably driving training error to near-zero exponentially fast.

---

### Q: HOG + SVM Face Detector (Dalal & Triggs style) — Sliding window + HOG + Linear SVM + NMS. Dlib uses this.

---

**A (Core Pipeline):**

```
Image → Image Pyramid → Sliding Window → HOG Features → Linear SVM → NMS → Detections
```

---

**A (Part 1 — HOG Features):**

**Why gradients instead of raw pixels?**
Raw pixel values change with lighting. Gradients capture **shape and edge structure** — relatively invariant to illumination.

**Step-by-step HOG on a 128×64 window:**

**Step 1 — Compute gradients at every pixel:**
```
Gx = I(x+1,y) - I(x-1,y)
Gy = I(x,y+1) - I(x,y-1)

Magnitude:  |G| = √(Gx² + Gy²)
Direction:  θ   = arctan(Gy / Gx)   ∈ [0°, 180°)  (unsigned)
```
Unsigned (0–180°) is used because a vertical edge looks the same regardless of which side is brighter.

**Step 2 — Divide window into 8×8 pixel cells:**
```
128×64 window → 16×8 = 128 cells
```

**Step 3 — Build a 9-bin orientation histogram per cell:**
```
Bins:  0°  20°  40°  60°  80°  100°  120°  140°  160°
Each pixel votes into nearest bin, weighted by gradient magnitude.
```

**Step 4 — Group cells into 2×2 blocks (16×16 px), L2-normalize:**
```
Block descriptor = 4 cell histograms = 4×9 = 36 values → L2-normalize
(handles local illumination changes across adjacent cells)
```

**Step 5 — Concatenate all block descriptors:**
```
105 block positions (50% overlap) × 36 = 3,780-dim HOG vector
```

**What HOG encodes for faces:**
- Eye socket arcs → curved gradient patterns
- Nose bridge → strong vertical gradient
- Mouth line → strong horizontal gradient
- Chin/brow contours → curved boundary gradients

---

**A (Part 2 — Linear SVM):**

$$\text{score}(x) = \mathbf{w}^T \phi(x) + b$$

- $\phi(x)$ = 3,780-dim HOG descriptor
- **Face** if score > 0, **Non-face** if score < 0

| Choice | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| Linear (not RBF kernel) | HOG is already high-dim and discriminative |
| SVM over logistic regression | Maximizes margin → better generalization |
| Hard-negative mining | Run detector on negatives → false positives become new training examples → retrain (2–3 rounds) |

Hard-negative mining is what makes it actually work — the SVM must see the specific patterns it confuses with faces.

---

**A (Part 3 — Sliding Window + Image Pyramid):**

```
Scale 1.0: original     → slide 128×64 window, stride 8px
Scale 0.85: shrink 15%  → slide same window
Scale 0.72: shrink 15%  → ...
(~7–10 scales total)
```

At each position/scale → compute HOG → evaluate SVM → record (x, y, scale, score) if score > threshold.
Result: hundreds of overlapping detections around true face locations.

---

**A (Part 4 — Non-Maximum Suppression):**

**Greedy NMS:**
```
1. Sort detections by SVM score (highest first)
2. Take top detection D₁ → keep it
3. Remove all Dᵢ where IoU(D₁, Dᵢ) > 0.5
4. Take next remaining → keep it, remove overlaps
5. Repeat until empty
```

$$\text{IoU}(A, B) = \frac{\text{Area}(A \cap B)}{\text{Area}(A \cup B)}$$

High IoU (>0.5) → same face → suppress lower-score one.

---

**A (Dlib's Frontal Face Detector):**

```python
import dlib
detector = dlib.get_frontal_face_detector()
dets = detector(img, 1)   # 1 = upsample once for small faces
```

| | Dalal & Triggs | Dlib face detector |
|--|---|---|
| Window size | 128×64 | 80×80 |
| Classifier | Linear SVM | Linear SVM + scan-line trick |
| Speed | ~1 fps (Python naive) | ~30 fps (optimized C++) |
| Accuracy | Pedestrian-tuned | ~95% frontal, degrades >30° |

Dlib's speed: **scan-line trick** — adjacent window positions share 7/8 of HOG cells → incremental update instead of full recompute.

---

**A (Comparison Table):**

| Property | Viola-Jones | HOG+SVM (Dlib) | MTCNN/RetinaFace |
|---------|------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Features | Haar (intensity) | HOG (gradient) | Learned (CNN) |
| Accuracy frontal | ~90% | ~95% | ~99%+ |
| Pose robustness | Frontal only | Frontal ±30° | ±90° |
| Speed (CPU) | Very fast | Fast | Slow–Medium |
| Year | 2001 | 2005 (adapted ~2010) | 2016 |

---

**Punchline for interviews:**
> HOG+SVM detects faces by sliding a window across an image pyramid, computing a 3,780-dim descriptor of oriented gradient histograms per window (capturing the spatial edge layout of faces), and scoring it with a linear SVM trained with hard-negative mining. Multiple overlapping detections are collapsed via greedy IoU-based NMS. Dlib's frontal detector is the canonical implementation — ~95% accuracy on frontal faces, fast on CPU, but degrades beyond ±30° pose because HOG is not rotation-invariant.
