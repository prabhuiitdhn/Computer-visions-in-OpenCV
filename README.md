The following implemented code of image processing is attached here using OpenCv.
   1. Loading, displaying and showing of images using OpenCV.
   2. Image transformation.
   3. Image drawing.
   4. Image arithmetic.
   5. Image masking, splitting and merging
   6. Color spaces (1-D, 2-D,3-D).
   7. Image histograms, equalization, the histogram of the masked image.
   8. Smoothing and blurring etc.
   9. EdgeDetector: prewitt edgeDetector, Sobel and Laplacian Operator.
   10. Application based on thresolding.

Here I have implemented all the common/basic concepts of computer vision.
